Paul Senior, thank you for the message and great question. I like to clarify
first that I am not simply a below-cash no-debt investor, I do have other
requirements, some general business insights, etc.

I am thinking about my strategy when all the below cash plays run out (look
like it will happen soon). I am not a trader, I usually purchase a stock and
intend to hold a core position for a long time. Such as my large position in
ALVR, and some leftover positions in SINA (selling recently above 20). When the
market is richly valued, I hope I will be holding a concentrated portfolio of
5-10 stocks that have growth potential. The MOST rewarding thing happens to a
value investor is when your stock purchased at cash value (such as my PHTN@3
and SINA@1.5) turn out to be a super star, a 10, 20 or 30 bagger! Even you have
20% stocks went bankruptcy, you are still outperforming market by a significant
margin.

There will be a time that I scratch my head for not being able to find stocks
to buy. I was doing that in 1999 when I saw many first time stock buyers
outperforming my return on purchase of JDSU and RHAT. I shorted them and some
positions were forced to cover. I will keep a lot of cash (or bonds) and
restrain my urge to short next time. I learned the short positions must be very
small and diversified.

I welcome any thoughts on this since it will be the BIG question to all of us
value investors. I will continue to add my thoughts here later.

Good luck to all! Steve168 (My only current buy is PCYC)

Paul, I did not mean to say that LLTC or MXIM are value buys at all! I agree
that there is not much margin of safety with ATML business strategy. However,
all such companies usually do well on the upside of a cycle.

By the way, I would say that having a major debt burden for a company in any
highly cyclical industry, like airlines, steel, semiconductor manufacturing, is
a STUPID business strategy - like betting the whole company and the jobs of all
its employees that there will never be that one downturn bad enough to knock it
out. Well the steel and airline companies now know how bad a strategy it was.

re ATML
I have followed this company for years and agree with Jeffrey that this is not
a lT investment. ATML diversifications means that it is running several subpar
business that tend to get hit at the same time. it is capital intensive because
they are still running their own fabs. over the last few years, ATML made a
little money late during the cyclical upswings and lost a lot during downtimes.
Unless management changes its business proposition, I don't think that ATML is
a an investment, maybe a speculation and sooner or later this company will
disappear one way or the other.

EMC is not a value stock now, imo. (p/sales & p/book are too high) I see that
at least certain aspects of the storage business are booming (esp. tape - of
all things! - from STK). I have no idea how sustainable or cyclical these
businesses are.

As far as I'm concerned EMC has made its good move already. Not to say that EMC
- once and maybe again, a very popular stock - won't continue its rise. I hope
it does: I'm still holding a losing position in ADPT and maybe further interest
in the sector will pull this stock up too.

Also fwiw, in glancing over some of the Scudder funds, I see only Scudder
Aggressive Growth has EMC as a top holding. I find it odd that the Vice
Chairman publicly mentions EMC but his fund managers don't seem to hold it
large. Perhaps it's possible I have outdated fund-holdings information?

Nestle - NSRGY
I bought 1/2 position today. Per Nestle's website, earnings are 19.5 CHF/share
at 275 ChF I get a PE of 14. However, when adjusted for the value of the 26%
stake in L'Oreal (11 B Euro) the PE sinks to 12. This is a very low price for a
high quality company like Nestle.

http://www.ir.nestle.com/Html/ManagementReport/p_financial_statement.asp?idleft

I do notice that my consumer stock picks NSRGY and UL/UN have underperformed.
Apparently topline revenue growth is lacking but my bet is that these stocks
are just not attractive in the momentum driven stock market betting on a
cyclical recovery. However based on my assumption of LT growth rates, both
consumer good stocks are very attractively valued compared to the rest of the

Market rant -
LT bonds have been whacked badly today after Greenspans speech and it seems
that the yields have begun to increase again.
On the other side , I read in the WSJ that mutual funds and hedge funds have
been buying the stocks with the highest beta's (more or less regardless of the
underlying fundamentals) to get a piece of the action. This situation seems to
be very much like 1999 and I wonder how this can end anything but badly. I will
continue to keep a high cash position (75% in my trading account) and wait for
things going the way they are meant to be, IMO. I think my consumer stalwarts
NSRGY and UL will outperform the market and I am ready to buy more after my 4

VICL had another positive news and jumped to $7.8 today. I sold early at $5.7

I won't be able to (and don't even try to) catch all the gains. My switch to
PCYC at $4.5 is doing well too, up 5-10 cents a day and it is $5.08 today. Not
much volume and most buying were at ask price, that means nobody is selling,
and buyers are not in a hurry to run it. The below cash play is very powerful,
resulted huge returns for me lately, but I am running out of ideas, PCYC is
probably the last one. Given the current positive market, I expect PCYC to go
up to $6 easily, more likely to $8-10 range in the next couple months.

Its interesting in that its NOT being publicized. Only shareholders of the

The ratio has yet to be finalized so we dont know how many shares will be

The private company seems to be well respected, has roughly $160 million in
annualized sales. The pinksheet company has roughly $5-6 million in net cash, a

Book review: "A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market"

excerps from The WSJ:

"John Allen Paulos is a mathematician, but he is also human. As a
mathematician, he has a pretty good theoretical grasp of the stock market. As a
human, he is prone to the same sorts of irrationalities the rest of us are. And
so, three years ago, around the peak of the market, he made a series of
increasingly foolish moves that culminated in his financial humiliation and his
decision to write this interesting book."

"...Instead of putting it (money he received) in an index fund -- his
investment policy until that point and one he knew to be theoretically sound,
if a bit boring -- he decided to buy some shares of WorldCom. The market was
booming, and Mr. Paulos was seduced (as which of us hasn't been?)"

"As WorldCom's price dropped, he "averaged down" by purchasing cheaper shares."

I know that game. Been there myself with WCOM. And now with MIR. Ouch. But at

 NSRGY looks like a better pick than my CSG. I'll keep CSG for now and start an

Nestle is very reasonably priced here:
Investment return is:
Organic growth : 3.5-4%
Inflation: 2% (to compare it with bonds)
Dividend yield: 2.6%
They should be able to get another 3-4% growth through acquisitions financed
from FCF.

Based on that my expected investment return would be 11-12.5%. Nestle has a AAA
credit rating a long operating history, negligeable dilution through stock
options, so i consider 11-12.5% LT expected return for a stock with these
characteristics and excellent deal. I know a lot of people bulk at these types
of returns. I would like higher returns as well but i have to accept much

long. A drawback to being a value investor is that patience (time) is usually
(imo) required before a situation works out satisfactorily. Unlike other
threads where posters mention a stock and post again hours or days later that
they're out with their profits, on this thread there's a long gap imo between
in and out (usually!). Given that the purpose of the thread is to find value
stocks and not to keep discussing specific stocks continually, some stocks just
get mentioned and then they disappear, seldom (or never) to emerge here again.
It's not easy to track stocks or remember how specific recommendations turn
out, so it's just not easy to see some of the success people here have
obtained. That's a drawback because it makes it makes it more difficult to see
the power of value investing and the success some people here have had in
utilizing their particular value investing methods.

I've gone through some recent past picks to mention a few that've worked out.
These aren't meant to be encompassing or inclusive - rather just more like
opportunities I recall I've missed. I haven't gone years back... if I did I'd
guess there are people sitting on multiple doubles or triples (or more) with
stocks they mentioned once or maybe twice here. Also, as a caveat, I'm aware
the markets have been kind to all sectors recently, so just because some stock
picks worked, that doesn't necessarily validate value investing as a superior
methodology to any other method. Nor am I intending to imply that certain
posters are superior in their abilities to anybody not mentioned. And I know
I've left out a bunch of other good stock picks and good posts. Feel free to
add any that might be deserving of mention or helpful to readers (or correct
any of my misstatements).

So Bob Rudd, nice call on your PLCM. Also, you had mentioned MCD near lows.
Brendan Watt was buying near there too. ($14+, p/e under 10)

Grommit's ACAS. Discussed a couple of times in each of past few years. Stock
near highs now. Patient and trusting investors never saw their dividend yield
drop much below 10% while they waited. (And the dividend kept increasing.)

Larry S.'s and Dale Baker's FBR. Rising stock price and high dividend yield.
Dale Baker's MAXF beginning in '01 has been a very good performer. Reminds me
of one letter different - MAXS - now approaching highs again. Don't know who's

Just to let you know, I am still holding MAXS.

And, you're right, these value plays take a long time to finally pan out but
usually the wait is very rewarding and I can't say that I mind waiting too much
especially if I have a few in the hopper. In that case one investment is
usually working out within in a brief enough time frame from the last, making
investing life interesting, and waiting for the others goes by somewhat
unnoticed.

I was always curious why Ben Graham chose a two year horizon for his value
picks to work out. It seems arbitrary to set a calendar date. I believe if I
were to set such a self imposed forced move I would force myself into making
mistakes.

I've continued holding companies like MAXS beyond two years (EBSC well past two
years -- over four years) after verifying the company's financial position
during periodic financial reviews. That gives me confidence to hold on. (EBSC
will yield me over 16% per annum, which I am satisfied with, although I believe
the company is worth much more than the management buyout price given the
company's cash flows and balance sheet).

FWIW, here are my notes:

Company: HELE
Date: 7/23/03
2004's expected earnings: $1.69
Estimated 5 yr. EPS growth rate: 9
P/E maximum if not 8.5: 10
Graham Fair Value: $33.31
Current Price: $18.78
$ difference: $14.53
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 77.39%

5/13/03: "Sales have increased in 33 of the past 36 quarters, with net income
increasing in 32 of these 36 quarters, demonstrating consistent financial
performance over the past nine years. Next year sales are expected to surpass
$500 million for the first time in our Company's 35 year history. Based upon
the momentum we have experienced over the past year, and our expectation for
that momentum to continue through the current year, we are anticipating fiscal
year 2004 to be another record year in both sales and earnings.

From 2002 Annual Report: Delivering on our commitment to product innovation,
Helen of Troy introduced 50 new products at the 2002 International Housewares
Show in Chicago. New product introductions included over fifteen new Dr.
Scholl's massager products. These newly introduced foot massagers incorporate
the most sought after consumer preferred features such as toe-touch control,
acupressure rollers, interchangeable massage attachments and multiple settings
for heat, massage and invigorating bubbles. We also introduced various new
products in our hair care appliance and personal care product lines.

HELE added 28,000 new stores in 2001 in a dramatic shift from direct sales
towards distribution channels. They rolled out 50 new products in January 2002
and are planning 12 new offering during fiscal 2002 (VL July 2002). Retail
stores sales now account for 60% of total sales, up from 40% a year ago. (VL
Oct. 2002).

Helen of Troy designs and develops hair-care appliances such as hair dryers,
curling irons, brush irons, lighted mirrors, and hairsetters. Brands include
Vidal Sassoon (under license from Procter & Gamble), Revlon(under license from
Revlon), Sunbeam, and Dr. Scoll’s. The products are marketed to retailers,
distributors, and the professional hair-care market in the United States,
Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Approximately 96% of the company's products are
made for consumption in the U.S.

re: HELE. I've no intention of selling my few shares. I'll look yet again to
see if I might add. Hard for me to step up for more now. (a personal problem)
Stock price is already near highs, with a higher than normal ROE and with
higher than normal (past) profit margins. OTOH, p/e has fluctuated quite a bit
over the past few years, and a 20 p/e has been seen in some years. That could
bring the stock to your Graham fair value if the company earns $1.69 next year
(2/'04). (I do suspect $1.69 is achievable assuming no deep shocks to the
economy or stock market.)

As you point out, lot of new products being introduced, there's a "dramatic"
shift in distribution channels, and the company is on a roll (increased profit
margins). Perhaps for me, in deciding whether to buy more HELE here, I ought to
look at the company as you do --- "a growth company that's value priced" rather
than as a value play that might(??) already have seen much of its value
recognized by the market.

Paul -- ramblings...

you've been the anchor of this thread. thanks for all the work and great
postings. good to see your posting mentioning all the winners posted on the
thread. of course we're happy to see our winners recognized and we're miffed
that we missed out on so many others.

OTOH, we cannot catch everything -- if our portfolio has a success rate
(whatever that is) of 70%, and our reject portfolio (the ones which were
contenders, but we rejected) has a success rate of 50%, then that would
probably be a fine record of beating the averages. Just a thought - probably
unmeasurable and not worth the effort anyway.

to HELE for this and other reasons stated.

Wow, talk about old news. I probably sold that at 7 six months later. I seem to

profits in a year then never looked at it again. Thats got to be 1998. Not a
bad trade but shoulda held on I guess. Funny that I haven't thought about that

about Saucony.

Anybody else holding Office Max trying to figure out what to do with Boise
Cascade shares? Or anybody know Boise Cascade well? Come on, somebody here has
to own Office Max - I think I paid 12% of sales for that last year - it was the
cheapest retailer available on price/sales. A real stinker, but it looks like

SCNYB. Can't find my original purchase records. Good thing my few shares were
bought in an IRA (so I don't need to prove cost basis). My file shows I added
to an exploratory position at $8 when it was recommended in 7/'00 issue of
Worth Mag. by W. Nasgovitz (Heartland Value). I sold a majority of my shares
2/'03 and 4/'03 at $10+ level. The remainder I'm still holding.

If my memory is right...OMX was originally discussed here about '97-'98 in
conjunction with Staples and Office Depot. (OMX was rated a distinct 3rd if I
recall.) A year or maybe two ago, President of OMX was interviewed in Barron's
wherein he said he believed his company was worth $10/sh, and he coyly
suggested he might entertain buyout offers there. (Stock was about $3+ then, so
his credibility with me was about nil.)
Beginning of this year, stock had come down a little from about $6, and it
seemed like a good time to start an exploratory, token position. Didn't buy
much, and never got around to studying it in real detail again (as in '97-'98).
I don't know what I'll do as regards the buyout offer. I probably ought to cash
out because my OMX shares are too few to piddle with even for me(!) OTOH, BCC
itself doesn't look too bad (p/sales, p/book). In another life I worked for a
company that used Boise for their office supplies, and Boise, imo, was very
good (response/service/cost). Right now, I'm leaning on taking the BCC stock
and considering that as an exploratory position for BCC.

TRCI has closed above the "magical" $5.00/share mark. I still own it and have
added to my position substantially since I first brought to this thread.

They've added retail agreements with WalMart, Home Depot and Radio Shack since
then.

I know some here look at charts, if one were to look at the max range on this
company, a huge double-bottom formation spanning 10 years has been taking
place. This projects out (to me) to a minimum of $12/share over the next two
years.

Growth rate in revenues and net income certainly seem to bring some credibility
to that possibility.

The last two years they have reported their quarterly report on 8/14 and 8/9
respectively. I guess we don't have long to wait to see what's up.

Hi, I am new to this board so would like to start with a stock idea.

Once a net-net, now trading at $11 - EV/normalized EBITDA of about 2.25. Capex
and interest expense is minimal.

The company makes post print machinery. Sells to major newpapers. It has a
great cash cycle. Backlog increased in Q1 2003. The stock could be a double
from here once the cycle turns.

Options issuance might be a problem. The company has 2 major competitors
(foreign) - Heidelberger (German) and a swiss one. Am still evaluating this ...

I know this stock was discussed here previously so any thoughts/insight would
be greatly appreciated.

Kaneb Pipeline (KPP)

As a word of warning to those who might be interested in KPP, it is a Master
Limited Partnership whose ownership requires the filing of K-1 tax forms. That
being said, MLPs are offering attractive yields (with a smidgin of growth)
relative to other asset classes.

However, whenever an MLP price goes up the MLP usually does a secondary
offering that temporarily depresses the stock price. I figure the huge number
of secondary offering is why these companies get so much analyst coverage ;)

BCC/OMX: I shorted BCC [very small position] on the news cause I it looked like
a vertical integration, they paid a fat price considering debt and $2.7B OMX
OBS OpLeases, and BCC's track record on acquisitions appears
poor(http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62169-2003Jul15.html).
Vertical acquisitions involving suppliers buying retailers are nearly always
disasters [Shaw Carpet's purchase of several carpet retailers, resulting loss
of HD biz, and sale of retailers at big loss not long after is one of many
examples]. OTOH, this may be something different...a reconfiguration of the
business away from manufacturing and into distribution. There's been some
indication that OMX complements their existing distribution business with OMX
being lacking commercial biz that ODP and Staples have...with BCC's
distribution biz filling that gap. I'm still holding the short cause it's
small, but I don't know the situation well enough to fight the market much
longer. The market may be saying that selling the timberlands might uncover
more value than the OMX deal destroys...but that's just a guess. Then again it
could just be the rising tide for the recently outperforming cyclicals...may
have to wait till that tide ebbs to tell who's swimming naked.

URS: Out again @19.20 [100% gain on all activity] on combination of the shelf

quality issues. The shelf has 7mm+ shares offered by 'selling stockholders' who
are NOT current management, but instead hold the shares from their sale of EG&G
to URS...so this is not as bad as insider selling usually is...just prior
owners cashing out. My concern is more about 20% of float additional supply
than 'They know more, and want out'. The earnings quality issue is very fuzzy,
but contract accounting presents big opportunities for fun and games that are
no fun for holders when the lights come on. There are also chart-based negative
indications. I've got a big gain in this since my initial foray <6 months ago,
and I tend to be a bit suspicious of large gains in short time frames...to sell
generous spikes, so I'm taking it off the table despite still reasonable EV

Kaneb Services:
TimbaBear,

I would like to hear your thoughts on this small-cap company. I appreciate all
of your work and thoughts.

http://www.kaneb.com/99annualreport/news/051601.html

Kaneb Services is changing their name of its Information Services Group to
Xtria "to reflect the integration of the company's information technology
business" (per Value Line Extended Version).

Kaneb is spinning off Kaneb Pipe Line Company (30 cents quarterly dividend) on
6/29/01 with a record date of 6/20/01. Kaneb Pipe Line Company will exist as a
LLC -- and will be spun off in the following ratio: 1 share of Kaneb Pipe Line
Company for every 3 shares of Kaneb (KAB).

Kaneb (KAB):
Thanks TimbaBear! I'll tell you what I know.

1) Kaneb will be added to the Russell 3000 index -- which will create index
purchases of the common stock and effective on 7/1/01.

http://www.russell.com/US/Indexes/US/membership/recon_additions.asp

2) I am not sure of the partnership implications. There have been a few real
estate (forest) deals that I have been involved with that have been
partnerships -- but am not clear on this situation. (I anticipate selling the
partnership shares -- and holding the higher growth common stock.) The
partnership shares are being spunoff 1 for every 3 Kaneb owned.

3) I am showing (according to Value Line Extended) Kaneb Services had 31.14
million shares at the end of 2000. I like the fact that Franklin Balance Sheet
is the top institutional holder -- since that fund does focus on the financial
statements.

Per Kaneb's earnings statement, dated 3/31/01, Kaneb had 31.261 (basic) million
shares and 32.984 (diluted).

4) I am not sure of the issue of the 1.9 million shares to be sold -- per the
6/5/01 filing. (FWIW: the 1st quarter of 2001 share of earnings includes a
$6,113,000 non-cash gain on the issuance of units by Kaneb Pipe Line Parners LP
(KPP)).

The financial statements are difficult to interpret due to Kaneb's "share of
the pipelines, terminaling and product marketing businesses are now required to
be reported in the financial statements as 'discontinued operations --
businesses to be distributed to common shareholders'".

Time will tell -- I'm not clear on all of the different factors involved. I do
believe that management is attempting to unlock value.

Thanks Timba.

TimbaBear or anyone,
"KSL will own the general partner interest and 5.1 million limited parter units
of Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P." --- this is an excerpt from the 6/6/01
company news.

1) KPP is already issued and trading (20.29 million outstanding shares).

2) KSL will be new symbol for the new KAB.

3) KSL owns 5.1 million KPP shares. I'm trying to identify where the 1 for 3
spinoff (which Kaneb will spinoff on 6/29/01) shares will come from?

4) This does seem like a good arbitrage opportunity -- if I can identify all of
the exact issues.

Based upon KPP trading already, @ $36, then this gives us part of the
equation...

Timba can take the credit, but let's state the

My apologies for not remembering how I came across the opportunity. Clearly,
you saw it before I did. My memory now also fails me with regard to the
spin-off, for I received 1-KSL and 3-XNR in the timing I took advantage of.
Perhaps KPP was at a different, earlier time? In any event, I hope you still
hold your positions as they have been very nice to us in total return.

Again, please accept my apologies, I did not mean to take credit where I had
not earned it and your post does ring some bells deep within the cobwebs. I
probably would not have made the move if you had not brought it to my attention

Want to reiterate my last below-cash play PCYC. I initially recommended at
$4.5, it went up to 5.05 in over a week, now retreated back to 4.6-4.7 range, I
believe the stock should reach $8-10 in the next 12 months. It is a biotech

Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2003 Results
Thursday July 17, 7:02 am ET

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 17, 2003--Diamond Offshore drilling Inc.
(NYSE:DO - News) today reported a net loss
for the second quarter of 2003 of $16.7 million, or $0.13 per share on a
diluted basis, compared with net income of
$12.0 million, or $0.09 per share on a diluted basis in the same period a year
earlier. Revenues for the second quarter
of 2003 were $163.2 million, compared with revenues of $187.8 million for the
second quarter of 2002.

 The second quarter results reflect an increase in the estimated asset lives
and salvage values of the Company's
drilling rigs to better reflect their remaining economic lives. The effect of
these changes in accounting estimates
was an increase in pre-tax income for the quarter of approximately $6.9
million, or $0.04 per diluted share. The
change is expected to increase pre-tax income for the year 2003 by
approximately $21.7 million, or $0.14 per share.
 .The Company made this determination by comparing its asset life and salvage
value assumptions with its own and
industry operating experience and making appropriate adjustments. Diamond
Offshore last revised the asset life
and salvage value assumptions of its fleet in 1995.

Diamond Offshore is a leader in deep water drilling. The Company's fleet of 47
offshore drilling rigs consists of 32
semisubmersibles, 14 jack-ups and one drillship. The fleet operates in the
waters of six of the world's seven
continents.

As previously announced, Diamond Offshore will provide an online, real-time
simulcast and rebroadcast of its 2003
second quarter earnings release conference call. The live broadcast of the
Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. quarterly
conference call will be available online at www.diamondoffshore.com on July 17,
2003, beginning at 9:00

Dale Baker, re. BLX: Still have it on my watch list. I have previously made two
forays into this stock and lost both times. Since BLX lend very short term to
companies that export, and they are the dominant lender for this type of
financing in several Latin American countries, I was surprised they came so
close to going bankrupt (according to pundits). One risk I hadn't considered
was that there were several Latin American banks that held stock in BLX (and
even more stock now that there's been a secondary), and if those banks
themselves got into trouble they could dump their shares on the market. This
was a real possibility apparently when Argentina was having its recent
upheavals. I didn't believe currency issues were a problem because I believed
the loans were short term and much of the trade denominated in US$. But
Argentina and Brazil currency problems DID affect BLX because (hedging or not),
people sold out of the stock on the bad news that related to currency
devaluation woes.

The recent secondary shores up the balance sheet. (My thesis was that the way
BLX business was structured, it wouldn't need help. I was wrong. There were
plenty of long term loans in Argentina; I missed seeing that.) The successful
secondary shows the the banks that bought the stock support BLX's business
model. These are the banks that will help their customers export using BLX
services. OTOH, those banks that bought the secondary at $6.88 have a quick,
good profit with the stock now at $10.45. That'd involve more than half of the
capital stock, so perhaps there's a lot of shares around to sell and take
profits on.

In good times BLX has been very profitable. I wouldn't be surprised to see
$2/sh. in '04. Which would give a forward p/e of about 5, making the stock
undervalued by about 50% perhaps/maybe/possibly.

I've been wrong on how I looked at this company before and as a consequence, I
can easily assume I've got it wrong again. So I'm not so sure I want to move
from watching to buying.

Low p/e and low psr. The very high debt/equity is worrisome and a good reason
to avoid this stock. I assume DRRA is aware that competitor Federal Mogul sank
because of its high debt, and so they (DRRA)are making a concerted effort to
reduce or control their debt exposure.

OT: HELE: -with a K, okay, talked myself into adding to my position too. Just a
little though.

Stock still has room to move based on p/e and growth possibilities, imo. Also
imo, that's assuming high profit margins can be sustained. Adding to the
position now though seems more risky to me than when the stock was trading
lower.

That I am adding at this point means I am acknowledging a judgmental error or
errors. I should have bought more than an exploratory position when I first
bought, and I should have bought more as the stock began its good ascent.

I call this post OT because it's easier on my psyche to assume I'm buying
reasonably cheaply now into a growth stock, which therefore is not of interest
to value investors. If I had to consider HELE a value stock here, then I'd have
to go further and admit I could be quite a nincompoop for stepping in to buy
this thing now when it's already moved up to a four-year high.

I guess you're up on the news today that BONT offered $7.00/share cash for
EBSC. We were hoping for a bidding war, and it's been one so far, perhaps more
to come.

Even without a bidding war, seems to me that with an offer of $7.00 and a
current price of $6.66 that one would get around 5% by holding just through the
end of September. Better than CD rates for a whole year. BONT's balance sheet
(a quick look only) seems to be able to support the new debt and EBSC's cash
flow would support it, so it doesn't seem very risky to me at all. To mitigate
the risk is the potential for higher bids. There would only be friction one way
(getting in) as the buyer would just pay cash (so no friction getting out).

Anyway, if you haven't seen the news blurb:

PCYC questions :-

Hi Steve, took a quick look at PCYC and some questions ...

1) For the 6 months ended dec 31st, 2002, r&d expense decreased to 11,703 as
compared to 20,125 due to personnel reductions. Do you have any info on where
these reductions were made ? Will it hurt the development pipeline in the
future ?

2) Cash burn - they have been averaging cash burn @ 28,945 for the past 3
years. So this year, they should have net cash + marketable securities = 72,468
which leaves a net value (excluding all liabilities) of about $4.3 at year end.

What are your estimates of net-net value at fiscal year end ?

3) Options - 654,469 oustanding at a weighted average excercise price of $4.14.
Do you see any dilution because of this ?

4) Drug trials - I am not very familiar with this process. Would you be able to
explain a little more about how this works and how long before the drug is
approved ?

5) Leases - The company has non-cancellable leases expiring in 2004. Do you
consider this as debt ? What do you think the company can get when they renew
the lease in 2004 ?

6) Competetion ?

Thanks,

Timba:

Great news on EBSC. I am still holding and hoping for higher bids.

It sure took a long time for the market to recognize any reasonable value for
EBSC. I believe a price for the company should be 20% to 50% north of $7.00,
and perhaps more. That would provide the purchaser somewhat of a bargain price
for the company, which they probably deserve given the company's past poor
performance over the years, and provide patient shareholders like ourselves a
fair exit price.

I remember Snyder, the largest shareholder, paid over $9.00 per share for a lot
of its holdings. It seems a value over $9.00 could be justified if Snyder paid
that price for a "value investment." I do think the company's financial results
after it emerged from bankruptcy were veiled by one special charge after
another. Despite the accounting charges and extraordinary items, EBSC's cash
flow and balance sheet remained fairly consistent and strong and could be very
valuable to a perspective purchaser.

I purchased more shares after the first announcement of interested bidders a
few months ago at $4.50 per share. I call that my arbitrage position. The arb
scenario you point out in your post seems interesting as well, but I have
difficulty getting over the fact that I could have made purchases of this
company several weeks (days) ago at much lower levels (stupid emotional
rationale). I might take a shot on acquiring more shares if the spread remains
and things firm up a bit. I would like to be more certain on the downside risk,
although over the long haul (before department stores completely lose their
flavor) I believe the market will recognize EBSC's true value even if things
fall completely apart. I also think $7.00 per share serves only as a floor on
what Bon Ton might ultimately pay for the company.

On another note, its interesting to see PPM selling huge amounts of its shares
prior to the Bon Ton announcement. So much for inside knowledge amongst
"institutional" holders and the "I wonder if they know something I don't know,"
mentality. I would say both PPM and I are pretty clueless.

I would love to hear your thoughts on an arbitrage at current levels, etc.

BONT accounting question from a friend of mine.

t

With BONT paying $80 million, is it possible that you would have to write the
PP&E and other assets down to ZERO at EBSC? If so, would that mean that the $20
million in annual depreciation and amortization at EBSC would be eliminated?
I'm not sure what the answer is, but I am becoming increasingly convinced that
the "bargain purchase" is going to, in and of itself, do wonders for the income
statement of BONT, or whoever the acquiring company is."

"With BONT paying $80 million, is it possible that you would have to write the

Under the purchase method, the excess of buying price over fair value of equity
is recorded as goodwill. In this case there will be no goodwill. Under the
pooling method, the companies will just combine their assets and liablities at
historical cost without recording any goodwill.

"If so, would that mean that the $20 million in annual depreciation and
amortization at EBSC would be eliminated?"

No. The depreciation and amortization accounts refer to the pp&e and the
capitalized leases of EBSC and these will be consolidated into BONT's figures.

Hope that answers your questions.

There are some really good arbitrageurs that occasionally post here who are

I was just sort of thinking (with the last post) that holding EBSC now was

A CD rate is fine but its not the same risk. I never said it was the same risk,
I said it was the same from my perspective.

You need to be willing to suffer with the orginal company (or take the loss). 

Well, in my earlier posts about EBSC, I said I was OK with their cash flow and
owning them for the cash flow if nothing materialized out of their offer to
sell themselves. Whether I would characterize owning the company as "suffering"
with them is an open question. I'm not sure what loss you refer to. But maybe
you were referring to arbitrage in general and not EBSC in specific?

Normally it seems its probably going to happen if the spread is 10%. I'm
interested in the deal if its above 15% but leary above 25%.

I'm not sure I get what you're saying here. The first part might be you're
saying if the spread between the offered price and current market is less than
10%, that that indicates a market confidence in the deal completion, but
perhaps you meant something different? The last part I'm not sure what 15% and
25% is referring to. Maybe 15% between bid and market is what you look for and
25% in that spread means too much uncertainty exists about the M&A completing?

Pick your deal carefully because ONE downer kills a whole bunch of winners

I am very careful these days.

Annualized return for smaller positions?? Dont waste your time. There arent
enough deals to get a true annualized deal. 

I guess one would have to define smaller deal. I'm sitting on 37%+ gain in 2+
months on EBSC. That's net gain. It really doesn't matter that much to me if it
is only on a few hundred shares or a few hundred thousand (Other than,
obviously, I'd be a lot richer with the latter).

I sense that you have a lot to say that is hidden behind your using so few
words and would like it if you could find a way to expand a bit on what you're
saying so I could, perhaps, gain more from your insights.

EBSC-"This is a long way from being over,"

DDN article

MORAINE | The bidding for Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. intensified Tuesday as the
Bon-Ton Stores Inc. of York, Pa., offered to buy Elder-Beerman for $7 per
share, or $80 million.
The Bon-Ton bid tops the $69 million, or $6 a share, bid by Wright Holdings
Inc., a company formed by Minneapolis-based private equity firm Goldner Hawn
Johnson & Morrison Inc. The Elder-Beerman board approved the deal with Wright
Holdings/Goldner Hawn on June 25, but the acquisition has yet to be accepted by
shareholders.
Tim Grumbacher, chairman and chief executive of Bon-Ton, told Elder-Beerman
Chairman Steve Mason in a letter that the combination of the two companies
would "be in the best interest of both companies' shareholders, customers and
employees."
Elder-Beerman said Tuesday it will proceed with the planned merger with Wright
Holdings while it opens its books and records to Bon-Ton for further review.
Bon-Ton said it is prepared to complete a transaction by Sept. 30, barring any
surprises.
Spokesmen for Dan Summers, an Ohio real estate developer whose company EB
Acquisition Ltd. initially bid $5.50 a share for Elder-Beerman, declined
comment Tuesday. Summers said July 11 he was prepared to increase his bid for
Elder-Beerman within 10 days.
Before Tuesday's announcement, Elder-Beerman said it planned to have a
shareholder vote this fall on the merger with Wright Holdings. Shareholders
controlling two-thirds of Elder-Beerman's 11.5 million shares must approve any
merger. The government must OK it as well.
Bon-Ton and Elder-Beerman sell similar goods and operate in similar markets.
Elder-Beerman employs 6,100 workers and operates 68 stores in Ohio, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin, while
Bon-Ton employs 8,700 workers and has 72 department stores in Connecticut,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Vermont and West Virginia.
For the 13 weeks ended May 3, Elder-Beerman’s revenues fell 7 percent to $138.6
million from the same period last year, while Bon-Ton’s revenues fell 6 percent
to $141.6 million. Elder-Beerman’s net loss for the quarter, was $2.5 million
before an accounting change. Bon-Ton’s net loss for the quarter was $2.9
million.
Michael Sweeney, Goldner Hawn's managing director, said his firm remains
committed to acquiring Elder-Beerman.
"We have a lot of respect for Bon-Ton," said Sweeney, who is expected to be
Elder-Beerman’s chairman if a deal is completed. "We think Bon-Ton is a very
credible retailer, but as things sit now, we have a fully financed, fully
negotiated signed merger agreement. All of our due diligence is complete, and
our interest in buying Elder-Beerman has never been higher."
Sweeney said Wright Holdings still plan to take Elder-Beerman private, keep its
headquarters in Moraine and keep its management intact.
Mary Kerr, Bon-Ton’s spokeswoman, declined comment on whether the headquarters
would move from the Miami Valley, management would be reorganized or the
store's name would change.
Elder-Beerman said in a proxy statement this month that after it announced its
agreement with Wright Holdings/Goldner Hawn, the company received a request
from "a retailer" to view company documents. Kerr said Tuesday Bon-Ton was not
that retailer.
The agreement between Elder-Beerman and Wright Holdings/Goldner Hawn gives it
exclusive right to meet or exceed any other offer for Elder-Beerman.
"This is a long way from being over," Sweeney said. "This is going to go on for
a while, I’m afraid. I was hoping it wouldn’t, but it looks like its going to
go on for a while."
Dan Butler, vice president of retail operations for the National Retail
Federation, based in Washington, D.C., said merging Elder-Beerman with Bon-Ton
would allow the combined company to negotiate lower prices so that they "can
meet or beat prices that they’re larger competitors may have."

You sure like to get things going huh ? There is not going to be negative

to equate it to the purchase price. In this case, the new carrying value may be
less than the fmv.

Godot, yes China stocks are red hot now.

I sold more SINA yesterday at 38.31 (GTC order triggered at open price, higher
than my limit order at 37). Now I only have 100 shares left as souvenior. I
bought SINA over a year ago at $1.5 when it was trading under cash value. It
was losing money and extremely out of favor at that time. It takes courage to
buy under cash stocks because the only reason they are under cash is business
does not look good.

I am buying PCYC since it is trading under cash and with phase III cancer drug
in trial with positive early results. I believe there will be a chance to sell
it at least 50% higher price when some positive news hit in the next 12 months.
Today my GTC buy order 3000 shares at 4.51 filled in many small 100 shares
lots, people were selling 100 shares lots to me, maybe some desperate small
shareholders finally gave up on the stock.

Never chase the stock on the run up, put buy orders at lower price bound,

Quasimodo, thank you for the message and great questions.

The R&D expense decrease is a positive sign that the company is conserving cash
to make more focused bets. I don't have info on where it cut.

They have a cancer drug in phase III trial, early results were positive, the
trial is ongoing, likely to have more positive results in the next couple
months.

Option size and strike price are reasonable. I don't know much about the

I will never be able to drill down all the details on any single stock so I am
making diversified bets on many under valued stocks. My large holdings are
ALVR, AIRN, EONC PCYC and DUSA. PCYC is the only stock I am buying at current

<<You need to be willing to suffer with the orginal company (or take the loss).
>>

I understand this statement clearly having sat with a large portion of my EBSC
shares for four years. Its best described as psychological torment. To boost
confidence I would review and re-review and re-review the financials and watch
the cash flow and debt reduction and buyback of 1/3 of the shares while the
price of the stock sank and no one came up to the plate to buy the company.
What really frightened me was occasionally over that period of time walking
through similar types of those old decrepit department stores from time to time
and viewing with my own eyes the inventory and merchandising.

<<<Pick your deal carefully because ONE downer kills a whole bunch of
winners>>>

When sizing up the arb situations I guess the potential annualized losses can
be as potent as the expected annualized gains.

This is always my stumbling point on most arbitrage deals, although in theory
EBSC shouldn't represent a problem here.

It seems most buyouts that I look at anticipate a small premium or spread above
an already inflated price for the company, so the downside risk always seems
huge. I always ask myself whether I would want to own the company if the deal
fell apart at my purchase price and usually the answer is no. In theory EBSC is
a bargain at $7.00 or at any price below so I guess I shouldn't mind owning
more shares at $6.769 waiting patiently for the buyout or whatever will
eventually cause EBSC to realize its true value to shareholders. The big
psychological hurdle is risking erosion of the large gain and nice return I
already have in the stock investing more in an arb play (amazingly I am sitting
on a 21% plus per annum long term gain on my core holding). I don't know if I
could take it if everything falls apart, temporarily of course (in theory at
least).

Then don't do it! Life is too short. For you it seems to have as much logic as
splitting a pair of Jacks against a dealer's 9 on a Black Jack Table. Life's
too short! You've finally been rewarded for your patience with this one. Savor
the flavor and keep your other investment dollars looking for a riper
opportunity.

Anywho, that's my 2 cents.

Hello Quasimodo and rjm,

I'm a financial reporting accountant and did the accounting for two
acquisitions for my company (which is neither EBSC nor BONT) this year. That
being said, I don't pretend to speak for BONT and how they're going to do their
accounting, but this is how I imagine it will be done:

My understanding is that BONT would pay $80 million while EBSC has a book value
of $205 million (1st Qtr earnings report). As has been stated, the pooling of
interests method of accounting doesn't exist any longer, there's only the
purchase method. So, when a purchase is done, the book value of the company
being purchased should be equal to the purchase price after the acquisition.
So, basically, EBSC's balance sheet would go from a $205 million book value to
an $80 million book value. That's a pretty big drop, eh? In the past, negative
goodwill was put onto the balance sheet and amortized, but this is no longer
allowed. Now, the drop generally occurs first by lowering the carrying value of
the long-term assets. So, my guess is that all of the long-term assets would be
lowered to a carrying value of 0 (from ~116 million) and then current assets
would be lowered also by ~9 million in order to get the book value of the
company equal to the purchase price.

Again, this is just a hypothetical analysis as to my opinion of would happen if
the deal went through and my analysis was done based on the 1st quarter balance
sheet which is obviously not going to be the real values now.

Thanks,

CW
(Holder of EBSC but not BONT)

I love your analogy. Thanks. Its the greedy side that sometimes has a way of

I like to hear everyone's opinion on MPH.

Stock trading at $1.7 while Yahoo shows cash at $4.8. No debt. Cash probably
burned to lower than that. One big insider was buying.

What is the liquidation value? How big is the chance that it can get
liquidated?

Thanks,

We expect that remaining cash reserves, cash flow from operations and available
bank borrowings will be sufficient for capital expenditures and other cash
needs during 2004 but we also anticipate that by the end of the 2004 season our
cash reserves will be fully depleted.

Hello Rjm2 and all,

I've really been pondering these new acquisition rules recently and wanted to
share my views as I think these new rules may impact value investing.

In regards to your friends thoughts:

<With BONT paying $80 million, is it possible that you would have to write the
PP&E and other assets down to ZERO at EBSC? If so, would that mean that the $20
million in annual depreciation and amortization at EBSC would be eliminated?
I'm not sure what the answer is, but I am becoming increasingly convinced that
the "bargain purchase" is going to, in and of itself, do wonders for the income
statement of BONT, or whoever the acquiring company is." >

As I stated in my previous message, I believe that any company purchasing EBSC
at $80 million or below would probably end up recording their fixed assets at 0
(see note at the bottom of this post as an addendum to my previous post). Now,
the question is, what composed the depreciation and amortization amount on
EBSC's income statement? I imagine it includes other things than just PP&E
depreciation, so I don't think all of the depreciation and amortization expense
of the EBSC would go away after the acquisition, but I do think it would be
substantially reduced if the fixed assets are recorded at 0 based on the
purchase price.

That being said, I really think this example of the possible way that the
company acquiring EBSC would be accounting for the acquisition shows how the
new rules of acquisition accounting (established a year or two ago?) really
enhance the attractiveness of purchasing companies below book value, in my
opinion.

Before these new rules came into effect, there were two main ways of accounting
for acquisitions (purchase and pooling methods), and it was hard to even guess
how companies were going to do their accounting because there were more
options. Furthermore, under the old purchase method, in this situation a
company would purchase EBSC, leave the fixed assets on the books and just
record a negative goodwill entry for the difference between the purchase price
of the acquisition and the company's book value. This negative goodwill balance
would then be amortized into income every year. It was a nice pickup into
income, but I think most financial analysts would have backed that out of 'real
income' in their analysis.

But now, things are different. A company that purchases another company under
its book value will need to record the fair value of the assets and liabilities
of the company being purchased and then lower the company's long-term assets
(generally fixed assets) to balance the company's balance sheet based on the
fact that the purchase price was lower than the book value.

To me, this enhances the attractiveness of purchasing a company at below its
book value. Now, not only can a company reduce costs by eliminating redundant
processes, but now the company will also save on Depreciation and amortization
as the acquired company's fixed assets will have a lower value.

Anyways, I may be too detailed into the accounting for people, but I thought it
was interesting and impacts value investing, specifically purchasing stock in
companies that might be acquisition targets.

Thanks for letting me ramble. :)

CW

ps. In regards to my previous post on the acquisition accounting for EBSC, my
calculations assume that the fair market values of the current assets of EBSC
and the total liabilities of the company are relatively equal to their current
book values (the material question to me would regard the fair market value of
their merchandise inventory). If they changed materially and were revalued at
market value during the acquisition accounting, my calculations would need to
be revised.

Started PTSX today @ 2.72. Tripped across it while looking at comparables to
LPAC, which I still hold, to see if EK bid had much chance of being trumped.
PTSX EV/FCF=4. With EK 'shopping' in this category, they may be interested in
similars. Strategically PTSX, which does infomercials, ads and such, might
benefit from marketing $'s shifting from telemarketing to approaches designed
