"I am still holding many deeply undervalued stocks bought in the past 12
months. I did unload some of them that became fairly valued, and bought some
small tech companies that survived the crash and demonstrating 10% sequential
revenue growth. I am also taking some short positions (such as SPY) as a hedge.
I am currently 65% net long versus 100% net long 3 months ago. I have been
wrong in the past so I may be wrong this time. But some hedging is needed to
ensure my great gains in the past year don't just go away. "

Steve, I cannot agree more with you that some hedgeing is required at this
stage. I own some QQQ puts and am considering DIA puts too. BEARX also looks
good as a hedge. This fund is almost inversely corelated to the S&P500 and
should do well if the market goes down.

Exactly. I think this is an important future market demand factor. I saw my

the market last Fall, got out in December, done nothing since, but is thinking

Does anyone have access to historical Length of Bull Market data? October to

There seems to be a significant difference between those who focus on stocks
and those who try to add market timing to the mix. Stockpickers are interested
in individual stories that offer compelling value; many market-timers seem to
treat "stocks" as more generic entities. If market conditions are good they
want to own 5-10-20-30 something-stocks so they are "in" the market. But if
they will dump those stocks as soon as market indicators don't look right, how
compelling could they have been as value investments?

I understand the people who game the market by playing futures, options and
index ETFs based on market timing. And I understand (and practice) individual
stock selection in an ongoing portfolio. Ditto scalpers and swing traders who
just want a point regardless of fundies.

But rushing in and out of a bunch of stocks almost at a whim based on guesses,
I don't see how many people can succeed at it. Maybe I just don't like the
concept personally.

To each their own. Variety makes the market.

You are trying to turn me into a market timer when I dont think thats the case,

I am NOT getting all the way out of stocks. Never have, probably never will.

At the same time, if a stock increases 250% in short order and one takes
profits and cannot find anything else to buy, what is one to do ? According to
you, BUY SOMETHING and quick.

You further talk about "whims" and "guesses".

To me, taking into account things that have WORKED for many,many years is not
whimsical guesswork.

After the crash of 87, I saw insider buy indicators go to all time highs, I
found multiple individual stocks that screamed "buy" and I did.

Now is pretty much the opposite of that and I am not allowed to be cautious ?

That just seems silly. Self-limiting and stubburn.

I like having cash available to buy stocks when they are deeply discounted.

If I am always 100% invested, I wont even have that cash without selling
something that is probably depressed at the time.

One of the first books I read was Norm Fosbacks Stock Market Logic. It goes
over LOTS of things that have worked.

Why cant an experienced investor use more than one thing ?

Again, I am not talking about wholesale going from 100 to 0% invested in 20%. I
mean fron 65% to 55% in a few weeks or something.

One thing I have learned over the years is you have to sell when the ducks are
quackin. Well, if you want a good price that is.

Staying 100% invested at all times is akin to betting the same thing at a
blackjack game no matter what the cards are showing.

Hitting an 18 is silly, Sure, you can win sometimes, but its still silly.

Stock allocation, per "Intelligent Investor":

"...(The investor) should divide his funds between high-grade bonds and
high-grade common stocks. We have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that
the investor should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his funds in
common stocks, with a consequent inverse range of between 75% and 25% in bonds.

However, even in 1973 there was a problem with this:

"If, as we have long believed, the stock market has lost contact with its old
bounds, and if new ones have not yet been established, then we can give the
investor no reliable rules by which to reduce his common-stock holdings toward
the 25% minimum and rebuild them later to the 75% maximum."

quasimodo, looks like your QUIP's moved up a bit. I've looked at it a couple of
times since your post on it here, and to me, it seems reasonably valued, no
great bargain. (my focus: price/sales & price/book)

It does seem that if QUIP's business is cyclical and now near lows, if business
does get better those good profit margins could return. So I agree with you
that the stock might rise up to the $20's again (from current $12.60).

I'll stay out of it because I don't see a catalyst, and I don't have any feel
for what QUIP's strengths might be compared to strong Euro. competitors. (If I
recall correctly, QUIP once prided themselves on their very strong employee
training and cross-training programs.)

If you don't have an alternative stock investment, maybe you should have been
less "mechanical" in selling that winner. I bought FARO in the low $2's, when
it was a growth stock selling at a value price, and mentioned it here near $3.
If I had sold it at 2.5 times in short order, I would have taken $6, and also
had nothing else to buy. In fact, I am sorry I did not add more at $8.80 on

Personally I invest like rjm2 here. If the stock is at the "sell" level, I
sell. I don't consider whether I have some other stock to invest in. So, yes,
theoretically, I could be at 100% cash. However, my "sell" is not mechanical in
a sense that I sell at 20% gain or 2 bagger or whatever. I sell when I consider
the stock price to be overpriced compared to current fundamentals by my own
measures. I also sell if the company no longer fits my investment criteria.
Then I don't look at the price at all.

Right now, I am 100% invested and still have a couple stocks that I would buy
if I had to sell one of my positions. So definitely not "100% cash" stock
levels.

Thanks for the comments ...

I think the stock could easily be in the 20s once the capital spending cylce
turns. The cash generation cycle is great here. In that sense, value itself is
a catalyst. At $10, the shares were too cheap, probably not now ...

"I'll stay out of it because I don't see a catalyst, and I don't have any feel
for what QUIP's strengths might be compared to strong Euro. competitors. (If I
recall correctly, QUIP once prided themselves on their very strong employee

I think they have been fending of competetion pretty well for the last 3-4
years. The decrease in topline revenues seems to be a result of the economy
rather than competitive pressures.

I have lightened up since the stock ran from $10 but am still holding.

Hello, I2. Nice to hear from you. I take seriously your alert that you are
reducing your equity exposure, since I presume you mostly have been a long-term
buy-and-holder. Even RPM, roughly a two-year holding if you're selling your '01
shares now, is short-term compared to some of the large caps you've said you
have held since the '60's or '70's, if I remember a post correctly.

Again, nice call on RPM. (Also mentioned here then by Bob Rudd.) Sorry I never
had the gumption to buy when we discussed it at lows. For the heck of it, this
a.m. I went back to my '01 posts during that month to see what I was buying
instead of RPM... yikes. So many turned out to be losers: CHTR, ELN, KNDL.
(aside: Still holding some ELN; I've liked KNDL and have added to position.)

NWL worked out well for you and a couple of other people here too. It's been

With the semiconductor industry showing signs of life, the electronics
distribution industry in general has come to life. The most leveraged play in
the group is SEMI, which I have mentioned before and owned off and on for many
years.

Here are two posts I put up earlier today on the company:

http://finance.messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&action=m&board=7086310&tid=faro&si
=7086310&mid=6011

http://finance.messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&action=m&board=7086310&tid=faro&si
=7086310&mid=6035

You do not want to own SEMI if you do not believe things are getting better in
the semiconductor manufacturing industry on a sustained basis. If you do, I
think the very worst the company does in such a recovery cycle is to reach
tangible book value, up 50% from here. I rate the stock a Buy only at $3.30 or
less, because I do not want less than that 50% minimum potential.

As Paul says, I have been wrong many times before and will be again.

shows RKH mostly moving up, not down:

good. Maybe if I knew more about its business arena, Bridgehampton, NY. Also

added a few more WSTD today...

doubt that this would be of interest to most here but i have made very good $$$
in penny stocks. believe it or not .... there are some value plays out there. i
am especially fond of certain gold and oil penny plays. today i sold 1000
shares of LITS [purchased at .03] to make my buy on WSTD. my 25k order was not
filled.

WSTD has less than 10 million OS and 3 insiders own about 41%. its an old
company with old-timers at the helm. the resort[shich the company is a major
shareholder of] does about 10 million per year in business:
http://www.snowking.com/

they also have some oil revenues.

i dont think the assets are shown at fair market value --- IOW is suspect they
are worth considerably more. outlook for bookings is favorable.

it does seem that when they make $$ they end up spending it -- right now they
are completing doing capital improvements [per filings] upgrading sprinkler and
alarm systems.

the market cap at .02 is around 200k and looks cheap to me. downside risk for
the long term penny player is minimul.

i estimate the float at around 5 million -- and the company has 3500
shareholders.

if i were ever going to visit the place i would call one of the directors and
tell them im a shareholder and ask for a discount. would not surprise if they
gave me one either. ahhhhh.....the pride of ownership :)

ROE isn't so great and looks like d/e is increasing. OTOH, profit margins are

The stock's now under its slowly increasing book value. A return to "normalcy"

May vs. today is an issue for me. Seems like stocks mentioned here back then
have mostly moved up. (Based on a spot check - they all look like they've
participated in the rally.) Now, I (and I assume others here) face a hold or
sell decision on some of those buys. I seem more attuned now to listen for
reasons to take profits. Pops other than value (e.g. inclusion in indexes,
analysts upgrades (now? -g-), insider sales, co. reporting "difficult" quarters
ahead, all make it a little more encouraging for me to push the sell button.

NTZ had a decent day today. The stock is heading in the right direction (not if
you want to average down however).

DCI reported its results this evening. Here is a summary:

14th Consecutive Yr Of Double-Digit Earnings Growth For Donaldson Co
Wednesday August 27, 6:59 pm ET

MINNEAPOLIS (Dow Jones)--Donaldson Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings increased 8.9%
to $27.1 million from $24.9 million last year, mostly due to foreign currency
translation.

The maker of filtration systems and replacement parts said it earned 60 cents a
share in the quarter, above last year's 55 cents and a penny better than Wall
Street estimates.

In a press release Wednesday, the company said sales increased 8.7% to $330.3
million from $303.9 million a year ago. The company said $21.2 million of that
increase was due to the impact of foreign currency translation.

The company said it sees low double-digit sales growth in both of its units in
2004.

It will also book a gain of 8 cents to 10 cents a share on the sale of its Ome
City, Japan, facility in the first half of fiscal 2004.

For the year, Donaldson's earnings increased to $95.3 million from $86.9
million last year. Earnings per share of $2.11 beat Wall Street estimates of $
2.10 and year-ago earnings of $1.90.

Annual sales rose to $1.22 billion from $1.13 billion a year ago.

For the year, foreign currency translation increased sales by $60.0 million and
net earnings by $4.5 million, the company said.

I eventually gave up on PLL and sold it. DCI just never looked like a bargain
to me. 'Course, with having its "14th Consecutive Yr Of Double-Digit Earnings

I sure like the 4.2% yield. The valuations seem cheap for a large company with
respectable growth rates compared to its smaller competitors:

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 26, 2003--Washington Mutual (NYSE:WM - News),
the nation's leading retailer of consumer financial services, opened a
record-setting 49 retail banking de novo stores in August. The majority of the
new banking stores, 32, opened yesterday in Chicago. This is the largest number
of retail banking stores Washington Mutual has opened in one month, and the
largest number opened in a day.

"Late last year we announced our intention to expand our retail banking store
network by almost 17 percent, or 250 stores in 2003 -- and we are on track to
reach that goal," said Deanna Oppenheimer, President, Banking and Financial
Services Group. "While other large banks have recently rediscovered retail
banking, more and more consumers are experiencing WaMu's unique brand of
friendly service and appealing, customer-centric products," Oppenheimer said,
noting that the company opened 143 retail banking stores in 2002.

Unlike most of its large competitors, Washington Mutual has always operated
under the strategy that customers like to meet bankers face-to-face, in a
comfortable setting.

WaMu's growth strategy is to provide its relaxed and warm retail banking
approach to customers within many of the country's 50 largest metropolitan
areas. At this time, WaMu is serving consumers and small businesses in 28 of
those cities. So far, the company has achieved 30 percent consumer household
market share in 12 of the top 50 metropolitan areas.

"We have found great success with our approach of introducing our revolutionary
retail banking concept in markets where we already have a substantial mortgage
banking presence," Oppenheimer said. "By the time we open retail banking stores
in a new city, we have name recognition and an established reputation for great
products and friendly service."

Washington Mutual recently announced that it would open 40 to 60 retail banking
stores in its newest market, Tampa-St. Petersburg, FL, starting in 2004.

Paul: It's better to be lucky than good. My thesis on videoconferencers WEBX &

immediate kick because of they primarily have a service model. PLCM was helped
some, but the most recent qtr didn't confirm the sort of major inflection point
I was looking for. What's surprising is the jump both got despite a forward
outlook that's not as positive as I expected.
The same could be said for a whole lot of stuff that's shot the moon since May.
I looked at many companies that have since doubled from their low's and just
couldn't see the value in what retrospectively would have been great buys. But
the gains appear more to be a reflection of price speculation than a
transformation of business prospects.

I think most everyone here at the time seemed to own WM, -- at around $32 in
november 2001. Since then, the 4% dividend plus 12% annualized cap gain has
given us 16% ROI. It's fair.

Madharry, I looked briefly at KTC and HANA. (KTC is #2 Korean capitalization
stock behind Samsung, according to Dow Jones.) Too difficult for me to figure.
The interlocking business/government environment or consortia are confusing to
me. It's my belief that Korean gov't and/or corporations do not much welcome
foreign ownership or foreign participation in their markets. If AIG is perhaps
about to make an investment in HANA, that might be a good sign for the future
of these companies. OTOH, maybe it's that HANA's too far gone, and foreigners
are HANA's only hope.

I suspect one needs to have some direct experience in Korea or some
Korean-American contacts (for those of us living here in USA) to properly
understand and weigh how valuable KTC & HANA might be relative to their stock
prices and future growth possibilities. That lets me out.

I just don't see anything here making for a compelling buy.

<<looking for a balance between holding on and letting go.>>

Paul, I am also thinking about what to do at this stage of the market. A lot of
stocks we discussed here couple months ago already had significant gain, some
doubled or tripled. I got the feeling of "rising tide lifting all boats" now. I
had same feeling in early 2000 but failed to take profits and hold onto cash
then, just to watch my big "unrealized gain" vanished. I DON'T want that happen
to me again.

I took some profit already, and started some short positions (too early), but
the economy appears to be turning the corner and market could still have more
upside to go technically, it is a tough decision to get the chips off the table
now. But I think I will do it, I would rather miss another 10-20% gain than
having my existing "unrealized gain" disappear.

I welcome any insightful comment from everyone, please specify how long you
have been in the market and best to refer some history you experienced to

NUTR: I'll start an exploratory position in this "manufacturer and marketer of

The positives are documented in this Motley Fool article:

http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2003/commentary030630mr.htm?source=eptyholn
303100&logvisit=y&npu=y

I like NUTR's debt reduction, and I'm attracted to the decent profit margins
and okay p/e. I don't like that sales are stalled:

http://quicken.com/investments/seceval/?p=NUTR&cmetric=rev

This company may be in the midst of transitioning from a cigar-butt to a proper
small cap company. I don't like though, that I'm stepping in now that stock
already has had a good run from about $2 to about $10:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NUTR&d=c&t=5y&l=on&z=b&q=l

And of course, now the insiders are taking profits.

The stock has stalled out, imo, over the past few months:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NUTR&d=c&k=c1&a=v&p=s&t=6m&l=on&z=m&q=l

The stock moved up - as have most stocks - but now has come back down to about
a point or so from April June level, on no adverse news. Given a market of so
many good moving stocks, it's disconcerting to me that NUTR is a stock not
participating (imo). (Mr. Market might be right in his assessment of the
stock.)

I'll assume NUTR's business is going to be at least steady (repeat customers),
and margins will remain good, and debt get reduced. That warrants a higher
multiple in this market than the current 9+, imo, and so I'll take an
exploratory position.

2004 and 2005. In fiscal year 2004...revenue growth of 17%, including the
impact of acquisitions. Earnings are currently anticipated to be in the range

what to do at this stage of the market...

I think you need to analyze what to do based on a micro-stockmarket point of
view. As been written about many times, if you have any faith in stock picking,
buy undervalued companies and wait.

I for one, think it's time to take some money off the table in certain
companies. CVS for one. And it's almost time to get my money back on Kroger and
SVU. And there are others.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cvs+kr+svu&d=0b

(Paul, I bet you have a hundred companies that are getting itchy over.)

But, like so many posting here, I'm having problems reinvesting. I have 50
stocks in my non-reit portfolio, and could just add to them, but I'm already
over-invested in the best of those.

I get ideas here occasionally, but not as frequent as they used to be. I think
I like slightly larger cap and more well established companies than a lot of
the picks posted here...

These are the companies that I wished I'd owned, but could never buy a few
years ago when they were ridiculously overpriced. I own a lot of them now, and
many are just overpriced as opposed to ridiculously overpriced. Happy I own
them now, but what to do about those that need to be sold...

Only finding "fair stocks" nowadays, not "undervalued stocks". *sigh*

If some of you could post your best 2 or 3 picks now to refresh our memory and
stimulate another look, I'd appreciate it.

STE could be okay around current level. (Who knows?)

This is it for me, your statement: "Relative PE are dangerous".

Roughly, p/e is 15x on next year's expected earnings. P/e has mostly, most
years averaged above 20. Ergo, relative (p/e) bargain. Question is, do I want
to pay 15x for the growth?

Also again, for me, it's another laggard stock in this market. Just lagging or
is there substantial, unknown reason why? (rhetorical question) Scary to me

With a PE of 30 the overall market seems very overvalued. I discover again a

It will limit upside however. IMO-WLM is a leader in recycled plastics and has

effectively, and capacity wise to participate in increasing volume demand. They
might sacrifice some margins at first to build volume. I'm personally looking

DUSA, one of my large holdings based on low price/cash approach got a jump
lately, up to $4.7 last week. My initial buying was around $2.25, added more on
the way up to $3.

It had $3.4 in cash with no debt, positive 12 month earning, a FDA approved
drug when I bought it couple months ago.

The jump last week was weird, there is still no news after the 60% move couple
days ago. Something is going on, likely on the good side.

Problem is those below cash plays vanished in the past couple months, many
moved up 50-100%. PCYC was my last buy around $4.5 (I posted here many times),

seen from Rocker's analysis. I expect (and I have been wrong many, many times)
no smoking gun and no stock crash based on any forthcoming company news or
Rocker reports. The stock may continue to fluctuate based on company news and

Grommit, I agree on the GRT preferred and the yahoo quotes:
I bought some GRT_pf today. 8.8% return is Ok given the very limited risk, IMO.
GRT stock itself looks somewhat vulnerable since the dividend coverage via FFO
is a bit tight but i don't see any issues with the preferred. Thanks for the
suggestion, i have been looking unsuccessfully for investment opportunities and
this is the first one that came along for quite some time.

I don't like the new yahoo quotes either and complained abut the cluttered view
of the new layout via questionaire.

ALVR received $23M order today, up 10% to $6.7.

A below cash value stock I recommended here in Feb 2003 at $1.86, is turning
into a growth star in a new booming sector. I am still holding a large position
and I think it still have upside to go. Citicorp, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan
Chase were new institution buyers in last quarter filing. They could have
bought under $2 had they hired me as an analyst or trader :-). I am looking for
such a job.

Below are my previous posts here on ALVR

ALVR new yearly high 2.85, still under cash 3.1, book 4.34. There were 2
over-million-shares-traded days on average daily volume 80K previously. Great
breakout pattern on chart, peer AIRN, PROX predict turning to profitable soon.
ALVR should be profitable too and we should see 5-6 in the next couple months.
Below are two of my previous posts, recommending it at 1.86 in Feb 2003.

ALVR recently made a 52-week high and still trading under cash value with no
debt. This is a classic Graham net cash value stock. I recommended here (see
below post) in Feb at $1.86, it closed 5/2 at 2.59, and still trending higher.
Take a look and see what you thinks. I am holding on to my large position.

MrCJ, thank you for your nice comment. My largest holding is ALVR now, trading
at 1.86 while cash at 3.14, book 4.36, and zero debt. Losing about 10c/Q, not
too bad, it is a leader in a niche market of Broadband Wireless Access. I
believe the company has a chance to be profitable in the next 12-18 months.
When that happened, it should be at $3-5.

From:- with a K
ANF has dropped to under $27 -- any interest here?

To narrow the list to the top stocks, we graded each contender on three
factors:

Valuation:
By looking at such ratios as price/earnings, price/sales and
price/earnings-to-growth — a measure of how much investors are paying for
projected earnings growth — we assessed whether the stock was trading at a
bargain.

Fundamentals:
To get a sense of each company's underlying financial and management strength,
we measured debt levels, return on equity, long-term growth rates and
same-store sales — the change in revenue at shops that have been open at least
a year, a key indicator in retail.

Buzz:
Based largely on our interviews with teens and industry insiders, we gauged the
excitement surrounding each brand and whether it seemed to be on an upswing.
Once we totaled up the scores, five stocks wound up at the head of the class.

Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF - News)
Stores: 344 Abercrombie & Fitch, 166 abercrombie, 104 Hollister
Valuation: A
Fundamentals: B-
Buzz: A-

The first thing you notice when you walk into the Abercrombie & Fitch store in
Garden State Plaza isn't the clothes. Not the faded jeans, the polos, the
hoodies or the T-shirts sporting vintage logos. No, the first thing you notice
is the help — petite blondes in tank tops and military shorts, and a hunky guy
with his shirt unbuttoned to reveal well-toned pecs. It's like seeing the
retailer's controversial catalog, the one you must be 18 to buy, come to life —
sans nudity, of course.

Abercrombie, as you may have guessed, is about more than selling clothes. It's
about selling an image, an attitude that teens want to be a part of. And as the
"aspirational" brand in its category, the company can charge higher prices. For
the most part, kids eat it up. In each of the past four semiannual surveys
conducted by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, high schoolers named Abercrombie &
Fitch their favorite clothing brand. And with $1.6 billion in revenue, it is
now the largest teen apparel retailer on the block.

Abercrombie takes pains to protect the brand's mystique: no television
commercials and no aggressive discounting. "The management team is very savvy,"
says Francisco Alonso, a retail analyst with T. Rowe Price. "They're
maintaining their price integrity to protect their brand, which is their most
valuable asset." That strategy may have cost the company during the downturn —
same-store sales have declined 7% a year, on average, over the past three years
— but should serve it well long term. And by not discounting, the chain has
kept its operating margin near 20%, one of the highest in the industry.
Abercrombie & Fitch clothes may be expensive, but the stock certainly isn't.
Its P/E of 15, based on 2003 earnings estimates, makes it quite a bargain. And
that's assuming only moderate 12% earnings growth this year. Analysts think the
pace will pick up after that, to a 17% annual clip over the next five years.

Credit CEO Michael Jeffries for directing the expansion of the New Albany,
Ohio-based company from 36 stores, when he took over in 1992, to more than 600
today. The question now is this: Having nearly saturated its market, how can
the company sustain that kind of growth? Jeffries thinks he has the answer in
the chain of Hollister stores his company launched three years ago, featuring
more moderately priced beach-inspired California-look clothing. The move allows
him to capitalize on the popularity of this laid-back style while keeping the
status of the Abercrombie & Fitch brand intact.

With their tiki-hut facade and dimly lit interiors, Hollister stores certainly
stand out in the mall, and customers seem to be responding. Monthly same-store
sales figures routinely show double-digit increases, and the brand has already
risen to the No. 5 spot in the Piper Jaffray survey. CEO Jeffries plans to
expand the chain rapidly, opening at least 80 stores both this year and next.
Ultimately, he thinks the chain could reach 600 to 800 — twice the current
number of Abercrombie & Fitch stores.

The company has another chain, called abercrombie, aimed at the 7- to
14-year-old crowd, and is developing a fourth concept. Though Jeffries has been
tight-lipped about details, analysts expect that the new chain will target the
over-25 set. That would allow customers to grow with the company, from
childhood to adulthood.

I'll take a very small exploratory position in AHG, and add it to my basket of
healthcare stocks.

http://money.excite.com/jsp/qt/full.jsp

AHG is more of a GAARP stock perhaps than a value stock. Still, there's a good
ROE, good profit margins and a reasonable (imo) p/e given those metrics.
Company shows improving results over past few years, and I expect '04 to be
another good year.

http://quicken.com/investments/seceval/?cmetric=rev&p=ahg

AHG hasn't much participated in the rally, and it seems to be a serial
acquirer. I'd say those aspects are a concern.

I'll ask yet another mutual fund question. Not that these questions make me
popular on Value Investing thread. :-))))

I am thinking of putting a little amount of money into Asia (India/China)
mutual fund. Would prefer no-load, low turnover, value minded fund. Probably
not closed-end fund, but I am open on this. I know TDF a bit, but no other
funds. Anyone has any good suggestions?

I am aware that everything has run up a lot since Spring as it has in US. So it
may not be the best time to invest. However, I would do dollar-cost averaging.
That's why I would prefer regular fund vs. closed end fund.

Thanks

Oh I promised myself three years ago I won't post anything on names I own
institutionally...oh but you make it so hard "with a K". Well, maybe if I leave
the name out. I'm thinking of a company with no debt on its balance sheet,
trading at about 11 times earnings after taking excess cash out of the market
cap. It has two of the hottest and most profitable, highest margin concepts in
its industry. The first is nearing saturation, the second, which begins with an
H, is just hitting critical mass and has years of growth in front of it.
Everybody is focused on one number, comp sales, but if we look at some other
numbers this is one of the most gorgeous set of financial statements I've seen,
whatever the valuation. I don't know of many companies that are able to grow at
20% while producing free cash flow, i.e. completely self-funding growth and
then some - and which have a very clear growth path rolling a concept out
across the country. So naah, no interest here...why don't you see if there's a
Buy Growth Companies for Half What They're Worth thread on SI. Maybe they might
have an opinion...

actually in the last six months or so perhaps the worst retailer I know of
(EBSC) has been by far the better stock. Sometimes 2% return on capital beats
40% return on capital if you buy it right. More kudos to the thread for that
pick.

Yes a rising interest rate is a risk factor for a fixed interest rate
investment like GRT_Pf. However I am happy with the interest rate of 8.8% in
the current environment, the interest rate differential to doing nothing (money
market fund) is about 7%, which is quite large , IMO. A 8.8% return with a
fairly low risk investment right now is very good and much better than I think
I would get from a broad based US stock index with a much higher risk. This
makes it a value pick according to my own criteria.

That's an interesting way of looking at it. My attitude has been that, for a
variety of reasons, the markets are providing investors with very low yields at
this point in history -- whether that be through fixed-income investments with
low interest rates or through equities trading at high P/Es (and hence low
E/Ps).

Low rates of return like these are "supposed" to represent "low risk", for the
obvious reason that companies need to compensate investors for taking on higher
risk by offering them a higher rate of return.

Presumably these low rates of return are partially a product of low inflation
and actions by the fed. But whatever the causes, reversion to the mean (and
gov't deficits, and inflationary monetary policies, etc.) will create future
rates substantially higher than those today.

In that context, owning a long-term fixed-income investment is inherently a
high-risk activity. A perpetual, callable, non-convertible preferred stock
would seem to maximize this risk.

My fear would be that the company will never actually need to redeem the shares
at $25/share, because by 2008 the interest rate environment will have lowered
their principal value substantially. Instead, the company will do a tender
offer and buy you out at a loss.

One other thing - I think the right standard of comparison for an investment
like this is the 30-year treasury (the closest risk-free thing to a
perpetuity), not a money-market fund. Using that as a benchmark, your yield
spread is more like 4%.

TCHC. I still don't get how this dink, family-controlled company in such a

resulting the ROE it has. But it keeps putting up good numbers. (For now
