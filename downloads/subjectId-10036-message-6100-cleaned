Re: On Infinium and entire ERP sector in general. I think the fear is still
growing out there that business might go into the deep freeze until Y2K passes.

But Y2K is one of the big drivers in ERP installations now. Many companies with
otherwise perfectly servicable legacy systems are opting to replace systems
entirely rather than venture an attempt to render legacy code Y2K compliant. I
remain skeptical that ERP will regain its previous momentum after 1/1/2000, as
one of the biggest (IMO) motivators in initiating an ERP conversion will have
gone away. My .02, business intelligence may well take center stage at that
point, as these ERP customers will want to get some useful information out of
their systems they paid so dearly for.

That said, which BI stocks are value stocks? IMO you can't swing a dead cat
without hitting an SQL generator (Cognos, Bus.Objects, Seagate Software, Brio,
etc. etc.). The difference between these products IMO are nominal. I would like
to find some different BI approach aside from SQL code generation of one
incarnation or another. I will take a closer look at stocks in this category
and post anything of interest. Please do the same!

Bob ***sortof off topic****

I agree on SAP. They're at the top of my ERP list, but I'm trying to wait for
at least $20 for my first buy, and I think odds are decent it might get there .
You're right - they're the gorilla and the cost of switching is huge. This is
proprietary architecture to the nth degree. (That said, my company recently
installed SAP in the admin area, and it's causing more headaches than the dept
can count.)

ORCL is on my list, but hopefully at much lower prices. ORCL's architecture,
from what I've learned, is more friendly to the growing trend toward
interconnectivity brought on by the internet, and management at ORCL has the
charisma to bring the industry with it. ORCL is also more open to partnerships,
which I like. With the pace of change picking up, it's unlikely that one
company can supply the total solution anymore, and this trend favors ORCL's
more open architecture.. Not that SAP will lose here, but the playing field
seems to be tilting slightly adversely for them. But they've still got their
customers by the neck.

In ERP I'm currently invested in ITWO (potential supply chain management
gorilla) and DSTM (courtesy Wright Sullivan's mention on this board).

Mike,

Y2K was a driver earlier, but it's getting late in the game to begin an
implementation. Recent slower results from the majority of ERP players (PSFT,
BAANF, and even SAP facing some difficulty) are attributable - at least
partially - to Y2K. ORCL is bucking the negative trend, here, but it's one of
the few.

Future ERP growth will likely be slower (most companies admit this now), and
this is working its way into stock valuations in the sector now. With SAP, I
don't think their stock price fully reflects the slower growth prospects going
forward - that's why I'm waiting to buy.

Return on Investment from big ERP implementations is not what many companies
were expecting so they're turning to other solutions with demonstrable returns.
ITWO is one that I like in this vein if you're interested, but this is not the
land of value stocks.

Re: ERP systems. This is a far out question,but how would you evaluate a

think it is possible to ferret out useful information from a company's IR
director? Real life example. Nash Finch(NAFC) just pulled the plug on 38
million in development costs and essentially said the systems were useless.
NAFC was a value play for me, a company with 240 consecutive monthly dividends,
solid midwest company in the food distribution business. I was delighted two
years ago when they announced that they were finally going to develop an
improved system. Last year they announced a delay in completing their
development because they had to concentrate on year 2K problems. That is when I
said Oh OH and dumped the stock that I had held for 4 years. In the past month
they dropped the bombshell about massive restructuring writeoffs including the
never implemented system. Now this is a solid company with new management and I
believe it fits the description of a value play. But the problem is I have no
way to know if they are capable of developing strategies to implement systems
which are absolutely critical to their industry, a la walmart. Any ideas?

The Fed's Stock Model

As of the close today the Federal Reserve stock model says that the S&P500 is
27.7% overvalued. I don't use this model because I am focusing on individual
businesses and I think it has some flaws that don't capture all the valuation
issues, but this is the biggest overvaluation I have ever seen it flash. More
interesting is that it uses IBES earnings estimates for the next 12 month's
"operating earnings" (before one time charges) as one of its inputs. The last
estimate from IBES I saw was $52. That's an expected mid-teen advance in
earnings from 1998. If we get a more normal 5%-7% the overvaluation is well
over 30%. If earnings are flat to down it's huge. If it has any use it gives us
an idea of what "Al" might be thinking.

I am up late toying with the idea of selling half my portfolio tomorrow. Even
though there is no stock in my portfolio I consider fully valued. And if I did
that, I would have to sell many at well below what I consider fair value.
Before you call me nuts, go back to my posts last July and tell me what is
different today.

The market breadth and the action in a few highflying stocks looks just like
last July just before the market tanked...which if you look back is the last
time I said something like this. But interest rates are what really worry me,
just because everybody is pretending they're not a problem. Interest rates were
FALLING last summer as the market tanked. When the market is trading at 25x
earnings and earnings are not growing, rising interest rates are a big problem.

After getting 75% of my money out of the market last July and buying a house, I
gradually got sucked back in with a smaller portfolio. Now I am fully invested
and wondering why. I can find plenty of stocks I consider cheap, but I learned
last July that they will drop too, maybe even more than the expensive stocks. I
have a very hard time finding a single "blue chip" that I consider low risk.
And the speculative froth on the internet stocks has fallen, but only to the
level of a month or so ago. These have another 75% to fall before they could
even be considered as intelligent investments. If I make the move tomorrow, it
will be impulsively, but it will be a well thought out impulse. If I do it,
I'll make the call here. I'm not quite there, but I'm close. So take this as a
gutless - for now, the market isn't open - call of a top - Dow 9366. When I
post that I've done it, that's my call.

How about Jones Pharma (JMED)? It's my pick of the month over
on my website. The company is an emerging pharma that has 18 straight
years of record profits and has been growing its equity at a 36%
compound annual rate for the last 10 years at least. Now at a PE of
22 on continuing operations' EPS. An asset sale and cash flow have swelled
their cash hoard to about 15% of the market cap (and there is no such thing as
a burn-rate with this co). They acquire underpromoted, approved drugs from big
pharma and market the heck out of them - no big, ongoing R&D expense.
Management has been showing it still has the touch with Levoxyl, and IMO this
one fits the profile of a Buffett company. Long-term holders have been
rewarded, but given the nature of the industry, the company IMO attracts a lot
of the wrong kind of investor, producing extended trading ranges. We've been in
one now for several years, and are approaching the lower end of it.

JMED sounds very interesting in your writeup. As you know, I tend toward the
"widget" companies. Pharmaceuticals is, as Buffett might say, well within my
circle of incompetence. But I know you have much better info on this kind of
business.

I sense we've got an accounting issue here. I have done my basic 10 minute
drill that I do on any attractive sounding company that somebody I respect
tells me to look at, but I just cannot for the life of me ground the basis for
your argument - that this company earns 30%+ on equity. What am I missing in
the accounting? Is it goodwill? Are you backing that out?

That said, this sounds like a business that should be a home run. Take products
that Merck has done the research on and decided is not worth their time...but
it is worth the time for an $800 million company. "Niche" is one of my favorite
words, and it sounds like that is the basis for JMED's strategy.

Also fill us in on what happened in late 1995. It looks like the stock went up
10 times in a year, and hasn't done anything since. This is one of the most
bizarre charts I've seen in a while.

And...sheepishly I admit...I did not sell anything today. After my diatribe
late last night I took a look at my portfolio and agreed with what Paul said. I
bought stocks, not the market. If they go down they go down. But I own
businesses that are worth more than what they are trading at now and I don't
need the cash any time soon. I still think the market is in for some major pain
in the next three months though, and one of these times its not going to bounce
back. (Think about it. The GDP grew at 6% in the last quarter. If the market

I sense we've got an accounting issue here 
Yes, in 1996, tangible book exploded upward, as did earnings and ROE, skewing
the averages. I got 38 % by finding compound annual growth from 1990 at 19.9M
equity, to a recent $230 M equity. That is skewed, so I used the lower EPS
growth, 28%, using 1990's 0.16 and the recent 1.16. I could go farther back to
1987, when tangible book was .32/share, and earnings were 0.06/share.

If you look at the annual ROE on an S&P sheet, it sits around 20% and has
fluctuated about that since 1987, which is the earliest data I have. What
happened in 95/96 is that JMED acquired what are two of its biggest sellers,
Levoxyl and Tapazole. Both treat thyroid disorders. This is a growing market.
In April 1998, the company sold its nutritional supplements business to TwinLab
for $55M, which in addition to strong cash flow has built its cash kitty.

The way I look at it, over the long term, this management can perform. They
have produced growth in sales and earnings ever since they founded the company
in 1981. Now, with a renewed focus on the high-margin pharmaceutical business
and a significant amount of cash, the company is like a coiled snake. Its last
16 acquisitions have been accretive to earnings, and in this case I am trusting
that management can continue. The last "blockbuster" acquisitions were in 1996,
and the stock price jumped quite a bit. I also have the feeling that the
divestment of the contract manufacturing and nutritional supplements business
is a prelude to another significant move on management's part. The balance
sheet is way underleveraged.

I think it is very hard to find an overlooked Buffett stock, but if I read in
the paper that BRK had just made a buyout offer for this company at $27/share,
I wouldn't be surprised. 10 years from now if the stock is at 200 I wouldn't be
surprised. Like all Buffett companies, there has to be some consistency, some
market power, and some great management. As far as I can tell, JMED meets
those.

The catch - this company gets its market power on a temporary basis across many
products. There has to be faith management can continue. And it isn't as
certain here as it is with Nebraska Furniture Mart. But then the management is
as old either.

Hi Mike,

Interesting pick with JMED. I'm trying to understand a bit more about there
niche. On the face of it they appear to be an out-sourced marketing and
distribution channel for the large pharmaceutical companies which makes me
wonder whether their margins are sustainable. You mention the problems inherent
with growth but how long can Big Pharma ignore this slice of the pie? What
other companies are playing this angle? Clearly, the time to own this stock is
during its growth phase as it expands to become the dominant player in its
niche and it seems like that is going on now.

As a physician dealing with drug reps do you think that there is a trend
towards the use of low-R&D "small pharma"? And finally (sorry for the barrage
of questions), what kind of licensing agreements are typically used? Out-right
ownership or some type of profit-sharing? Quality of management appears proven
by the balance sheet but future profitability seems to be dependent in large
part by the details of these agreements. It is encouraging to see the company
sustain cash and shareprice during a period when they lack a new block-buster
drug purchase.

No. They are expert marketers and evaluators who identify then
acquire underpromoted (because of the small market) but FDA-approved
drugs from big pharma. JMED is its own company, and they do
very well because they increase the market share of the drugs
they acquire.

how long can Big Pharma ignore this slice of the pie?
Forever. Big pharma, by definition, gets bigger bang for its
buck promoting drugs for the several-hundred-million dollar
markets. JMED's total revenues now are just over $120 million.
Big Pharma will never want to sell drugs to tiny markets.

Its niche is in its expertise in marketing drugs, and in
penetrating certain small markets, such as endocrine. That
niche can be exploited much much more before big pharma
even starts to care.

I like that JMED picks markets where there is no reason
for dominance. Levoxyl should not be second banana to Synthroid.
No reason. Yet Synthroid wins 70+% to 24%. So Jones gets
Levoxyl and can continue expanding its market, eating into synthroid.
Jones has grown Levoxyl's share from 15 to 24% since acquisition,
at Synthroid's expense, giving Jones strong cash flows.

For anyone still interested in St. Joe:

St. Joe Co. (JOE) announced today that they are auctioning 800,000 acres of
non-developable property. This follows JOE's comprehensive analysis which
determined their long-term development plans and identified which parcels are
in the path of their development and which may be sold.

I continue to like JOE's prospects as a long term (retirement account type)
holding, and the price is now very reasonable. CEO Rummell has focused JOE on a
development strategy. Recent acquisitions (e.g. Prudential FLA Realty) need
further review but they are headed in the right direction.

I don't see a specific catalyst on the horizon for JOE, but it is a company in
transformation and I like their assets and where they're headed.

All that being said, JOE's related RR company, Florida East Coast Industries
(FLA), also bears looking at because may offer a better opportunity in the near
term. FLA hs two significant assets besides the railroad: Valuable real estate
(being developed in conjunction with JOE), and lots of fiber optic cables
connecting most of Florida's population centers. FLA bears watching over the
next couple years.

Yes, my opinion is that JOE has the best assets and a management team who knows
how to develop it.

TRC has loads of raw land an hour north of LA, but my understanding is that
some is developable soon, but by far most is not.

JOE on the other hand has miles of stunning beach property and is moving right
now to develop it. This will be a long process but should start to bear
significant fruit in the next couple years. Therefore I see JOE as both a
relatively safe asset play as well as having huge growth potential.

If you're interested, I can post some links to extensive local newspaper
articles which give a much better perspective on JOE from ground zero, in the
Florida panhandle. I don't have time to gather and post this info right now.

Caveat: I am an engineer, not a real estate person. But JOE is not very
complicated.

RE: The St. Joe Co. (JOE)

The following four links will help anyone interested in understanding The St.
Joe Co. from a local (North Florida) point of view. I hope this information is
useful.

From Florida Trend magazine, August 1998:
http://www.floridatrend.com/issue/default.asp?a=2996&s=1&d=8/1/98

Speeches by CEO Peter Rummell from St. Joe's web site:
http://www.joe.com/about/management/speeches.html

Pensacola News Journal has an excellent series of articles from Jan. 31-Feb. 1,
1999:
http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/2000/stories/stjoe.htm

Panama City News Herald has many in-depth articles. Pick "site search" on the
main page, then search for "St. Joe Co." or "Rummell":
http://www.newsherald.com/

I have taken the liberty of copying the first three paragraphs of the Florida
Trend article below. It's quite a tale, and it may pique someone's interest.

<From Florida Trend 8/1/98>

In an aging mansion on the outskirts of Tallahassee, in a dusty storage closet
off an upstairs bathroom, sit a dozen or so cases of Old Forester whiskey, some
bottles dating from the 1940s. Both mansion and whiskey are the property of The
St. Joe Co.; the liquor was the personal cache of the late Ed Ball, the
company's legendary tight-fisted chief executive who drank a toast every night
to his enemies' demise - usually several. "I find four to six highballs very
relaxing," said Ball, who spent 40 years buying up railroads, banks and huge
swaths of north Florida pine forests, making the St. Joe Paper Co. the state's
largest landowner in the process. It's no accident that Ball's whiskey sits
untouched; the managers who ran the company after Ball died in 1981 didn't
disturb much of anything about St. Joe. Both its massive north Florida land
holdings - all 1.1 million acres - and its cash, now more than $500 million,
languished over the years as other parts of the state and other companies
boomed.

Ball's liquor still lies unopened, but his company has put on some new clothes
and headed for the party, escorted by chairman and chief executive officer
Peter S. Rummell, the former real estate chief for the Walt Disney Co. who cut
his teeth developing high-profile Florida communities such as Sawgrass in Ponte
Vedra Beach and Celebration near Orlando. Since a group of activist
shareholders and outside directors that included Jacksonville businessman
Herbert Hill Peyton mounted a push that installed Rummell last year, the new
CEO has frenetically set about reshaping Ball's creaky behemoth as a major
regional - even national - real estate developer, and has set in motion a plan
that could remake the whole northwest corner of the state.

Gone is the old St. Joe Paper Co. name, replaced by the St. Joe Co. with a new
ticker symbol [NYSE-JOE] and a new logo, a stylized bird taking flight. Gone
also are all but one of the company's previous seven top managers, replaced
with high-priced new blood. More notable, the bespectacled Rummell has
catapulted the company into a series of partnerships, acquisitions and real
estate ventures, including three massive residential real estate developments
in the Panhandle that the company will try to carry out simultaneously. Among
the other deals: Rummell's $12 million purchase of Arvida, one of Florida's
most storied residential community builders, and the $90 million pending
acquisition of the Prudential Florida realty brokerage.

I'm glad the JOE articles were helpful. I spent the better part of a recent
weekend tracking down every obscure iota I could find on JOE, especially from
independent sources. I have a binder full, but those 4 links lead to most of
the important information.

>>what has caused the stock to lose half its value in the last year?

JOE's CEO, Peter Rummell, came aboard from Disney in early 1997. The stock rose
through 1997 as investors decided that a sleeping giant had awakened. While
Rummell has made many positive moves toward unlocking the value of JOE's
assets, a few percieved missteps have caused negative reactions. These include
JOE's tiny investment in an "event-based entertainment company" (Entros), and
JOE's joint venture with the NFL for NFL-themed restaurants. Entros remains
tiny and insignificant, and the NFL venture was quickly discarded last year.
But these are still seen as a black eye on management, as a loss of focus from
the core real estate mission.

JOE's majority owner, the Alfred DuPont Testamentary Trust, did a secondary
offering at $34 about a year ago, and this generated a lot of interest.
However, once the secondary was sold and there was no new catalyst, JOE began
to drop (along with many REIT's). It has stayed down most of this year.

James Clarke called the rise of JOE on this board 1.5 years ago, and also
called the top a bit later. Quite a call, and not just luck--his logic was
impeccable. (See his JOE posts 6-18 months ago on this thread--they're worth
reading). He has commented recently on this thread about JOE's current lack of
a catalyst.

I don't see these announcements of land sales as a huge catalyst. I think JOE
will soon start a long slow climb upward, and there probably won't be a single
catalyst. But when I look five or ten years out, I can't see a picture where
JOE's value isn't tremendously higher than it is now.

Paul's post mentions that "CDX is better managed" than JOE. I do not take issue
with Paul's judgement, but when I look at Peter Rummell's background (chairman
of Disney Imagineering, Arvida before that) and his team of Florida real estate
veterans, I'm not sure what more I could ask for.

The one thing I gleaned from those articles is that JOE is moving much faster
than people realize. The investment community consensus seems to be that it
will take 7-10 years for JOE's residential developments to bear serious fruit,
due to Florida's rigorous DRI (development of regional impact) approval
process. My impression is that JOE's developments are generally welcomed by the
local communities and are having very little difficulty with approvals, and
that we can expect benefits in the 2-4 year time frame.

I have loads more thoughts and info on JOE but don't want to go on ad nauseum
here. But a careful reading of the newspaper articles indicates to me that JOE
is a company with huge ambitions, to remake the Florida panhandle (a.k.a. "the
Redneck Riviera"). I don't think the investment community realizes just how
encompassing those plans are. My take is that they'll do it methodically and a
whole lot of money will be made in the process.

But certainly a strong case to the contrary can also be made.

As to a basic valuation of JOE, Michael Burry's valuations from a year or so
back are still pretty much valid, except for a few minor changes. I'm not
confident making the call on whether JOE's assets are worth exactly $30 or $40
per share, but it's in that range.

Regarding the value of the timberlands being sold, $900-$1000/acre is a good
ballpark figure. So we're looking at another $700 to $800 million in cash. Wow.
And they get to keep the 30 miles of beachfront, and all the other developable
land...

Okay, James is right about the taxes knocking that number down significantly,
so maybe they only get $450-$500 million for the undevelopable land.

I'm going to update the valuation but won't get to it for a few days. Will post
it then. Sorry to run so long on this.

Excellent discussion on JOE.

General question for the thread: How does one evaluate the impact of
class-action lawsuits for which there appears no merit other than a decreasing
stock price? I have been tracking the ERP software companies (JDAS, JDEC, PSFT,
SAP, BAANF, ITWO, INFM) looking for a recovery play. All have declined in
shareprice during a terrible market period which has precipitated a storm of
lawsuits alleging that management misled investors. Nowadays, it seems that
whenever a stock price declines the lawyers feel the need to fish for
grievances. My fear is that even though the case may be thrown out the company
may face high legal fees which may impact earnings.

Does anybody have any experience in this area who could relate some general
guidelines for this type of thing?

TIA,
John

My general experience is to ignore them, or consider it an opportunity
to buy if a stock gets hit, especially if there is no clear mgmt failure. I
would be a bit more careful if there was evidence of mgmt fraud (or phony
books) -- only because the impact of the fraud being much worse (and harder to
figure out) on the company than the second order effect, the shareholder
lawsuit.

You have to remember several things. The lawyers have no interest in their
clients, only themselves. Therefore, their interest is collecting their fees
not getting their clients anything. (The maximum recovery is less than 10% of
the damage.) In collecting their fees,
they have no interest in damaging the company's ability to pay them and most
times companies have insurance coverage which mitigates the damages, and the
lawyers clearly have any insurance in mind in the first place. They are almost
always settled before trial, because of the lack of real harm caused by the
company in most cases and the lack of real interest in their clients by the
lawyers.

That sounds quite cynical. However, I have participated in quite a few over the
years and that is the way it works in practice.

Jeffrey I agree with you wrt shareholder suits in general. There are two types
in a nutshell: (1)accounting debacles, in which lawsuits and quite possibly
handcuffs are definitely justified; and (2)garbage suits where a company misses
by a penny or forecasts difficult future, stock gets a short term haircut, and
the bottom shelf legal firms find at least one dufus with a pulse and an odd
lot of shares to be the lead plantiff in a phony-baloney lawsuit.

That said, OTOH, I take very seriously suits from angry clients who feel they
have been burnt by lofty ERP promises and/or poor implementation. True, in such
cases there is often plenty of blame to go around, especially when an ERP
vendor signs on an unqualified customer lacking core competencies to make an
ERP install successful. But these IMO are the suits to be taken seriously as an
investor. As previously discussed on this thread, I welcome more discussion on
specific ERP client versus ERP vendor(s) litigation. Cheers...

Mike, I covered both categories of your first paragraph in my post.
In accounting debacles/fraud, that issue in and of itself is far worse than the
minor consequences of the shareholder lawsuit.

Your second paragraph deals with suits from clients for non-performance of a
purchased product. As you point out they are not to be taken lightly. Recovery
could be the entire amount of the software purchase price, plus damages to the
business if provable, plus possibly punitive damages in remote circumstances
where the supplier willfully and demonstrably failed to address problems their
software caused a business in a timely and appropriate manner. Such suits if
widespread could have catastrophic consequences. Even if they do not it
certainly suggests significant problems with the products,
procedures and management of the supplier. I would tend to avoid such a company
as the risk, including the implied possibility of other lawsuits, is difficult
to assess and quantify.

The Restaurant Business:

In my research, I've been finding that you can still find an occasional company
that appears cheap on earnings, free cash flow, has some significant growth
prospects, and has average return on equity or above. Granted these are not
great businesses and have above average risk. But I was wondering....

When I've looked at the occasional takeover price, there appears to be no
standard valuation method in cash transactions that I can see.

How does Wall St. value these businesses in general? Are they using a higher
cost of capital than average, multiple of sales, cash flow, earnings.

There seems to be some pockets of value in this area in a market where I can't
find anything.

I own Applebees and Sbarros right now. I bought both at prices that seemed to
good to let get away. But I'm getting interested in a few others also. Just
curious to how Wall St. thinks about this business.

Eventually something will catch up with the market, someday. But that is hardly
saying anything.

What is important about your chart is its lack of predictive value. In other
words the correlation between a cash level and the market level say 1-2 years
hence is not good. All I would say is that it is one long term negative factor.

Also, cash flow into mutual funds is probably more important than cash levels.
In other words, if cash flow is very high, the cash level is less important
(easily increased from cash flow) than if the cash flow is low. In fact, if one
were to know independently that cash flows have been increasing for years, as I
suspect is the case, then a declining cash position is a logical result, for
the reason I gave.

I am concerned that Year 2000 issues will eventually knock off this market. For
one thing this will become an ever hotter press topic and probably scare people
into being more conservative. Second, although most large companies have dealt
with Year 2000 in 1998, incompetent government and little companies without
resources have probably not.
Therefore, my guess is that big outfits will have problems with little
suppliers and with government.

One story my wife heard is that of a tiny retailer in nowhereland
which had a charge card system which would not accept cards with a 2000
expiration date.

Fear of the impact of these problems may have an impact on the stock market,
which would lead to a (reduced) wealth effect on the real economy.

Put all of this together and I suspect we will have a small recession a bit
down the road.

Went to an institutional money manager meeting once where the opinion expressed

actually LAGGING indicators. The more the market would drop the less money
would flow in. Turnaround in cash flows into mutuals would turn up AFTER the
market had already turned. It seems that when the public sees a bad month they
want to "wait and see whats going to happen". When the market goes back up,

Mike, do you have any idea why NH has gotten relatively weaker than
DE, CSE and AG? Their latest earnings report indicates an expectation that
North America will be the weakest in 1999 relative to 1998. They
have more balanced (less) exposure to the US versus non-US than the others.

In any case, I started buying again today at $9.25. Note that the $.55 annual
dividend payable 6/1/99 was just declared and is 75% accrued as of March 1.
Therefore, buying at $9.25 is in fact really buying at
$8.84 ($9.25 - .75 X $.55). With a $.55 dividend that is an annual return of
6.22%.

Any comments from our value peers?

On this reasoning, $8.25 would be a return of 7.02%.

Mike,

>>I suggest you check out the premium Buffet paid for
Dairy Queen (INDQA I think was the symbol); how did he calc it? <<

That was one of the deals I casually looked at in my effort to understand the
values in that business. My "guess" is that he liked it because they make a lot
of their money as franchisers as opposed to owners. That model has an advantage
over ownership in that the capital expenditures are lower. (offset by slightly
less money making in ownership) If I remember correctly, the ROE was about 20%
(give or take). That's pretty impressive. The free cash generation was also
high. Lastly, they also had what I would consider to be excess cash on the
balance sheet that could immediately be depoloyed elsewhere. So if you
subtracted the excess cash, adjusted earnings for interest income, the price
starts looking kind of attractive even though it was a slow grower. Buffett can
always deploy the excess cash and future free cash into more profitable
ventures where Dairy Queen seemed more limited.

My thinking on Sbarros was the same when I bought it. But that deal has not
worked out especially well for me even though I'll make some money. The
eventual price offered by the Sbarro family to take it private was
disappointing to me. Sbarro has about $5-$6 in excess cash and many other
similar qualities.

"Buffett Sees Danger In Stock Market" -- Reuters

[The Reuters article copied below tries to make Buffett sound much more
alarmist than he actually was. In fact, Buffett deftly deflected all of
Koppel's invitations to cry "Wolf!", as would be expected of a great statesman
of finance.

porx recollection is that, in response to Koppel's question about what a 25-yr
old making $20,000 to $30,000 per year should do, Buffett mentioned an Index
fund, as one possibility. However, he was practically muffling the answer into
his jacket sleeve, such was his lack of real enthusiasm. Perhaps he viewed it
as porc does -- the lesser evil, when compared to timing.

Yet, Buffett was quite emphatic on one point -- don't make any purchases on
borrowed money. Not only does this mean not using margin, but, as he mentioned
earlier in the interview, it means paying off credit card debts before
committing any funds in the Market, as there is no realistic possibility of
earning more in equities, at these inflated prices, as the 15% or more that
credit cards charge annually.]

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said
Tuesday the U.S. stock market had seen virtually unprecedented
increases in recent years and was in a ''dangerous'' period that
could see stock values drop sharply.

Stocks had risen ''terrifically'' over the past 15 years, driven
higher by lower interest rates and rising return on equity,
Buffett told the ABC News ''Nightline'' program.

''After a while the very act of stocks going up starts drawing in
other people who get excited about the fact that their neighbor
made some money ... and that's when you get into the dangerous
periods,'' he said.

Asked when the bubble would burst, Buffett said, ''You never
know. You know that valuations are high, by historic standard.
You know that the level of speculation is high, by any historic
standards, and you now that it doesn't go on forever ... but you
don't know when it ends.''

Buffett told ABC's Ted Koppel the ongoing market rally had
''gathered a lot of momentum in the last few years,'' signaling
that a downturn could be around the corner.

''The last three years prior to this one, when the S & P
(Standard & Poor's index) has gone up 20 percent a year, that's
almost unprecedented,'' he said in the television interview,
filmed at a Dairy Queen restaurant in Omaha, Nebraska, where the
investor lives.

Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc (), owns Dairy
Queen.

Buffett told ABC he had built a $30 billion endowment fund --
essentially his personal net worth -- for philanthropic purposes
when he dies and said a team of six well-qualified people helped
determine how that money would be put to use.

He said one area he was particularly concerned about was the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology, and said he was
funding some efforts to study the problem. But he acknowledged
that he did not know how to ''attack the problem with money.''

He said his three children would receive some money from his
estate after he died, but he did not believe in the ''divine
right of the womb'' and felt they should prove themselves in
society, rather than inherit the great wealth he has amassed in
his lifetime.

All, let's discuss: Starwood Hotels(HOT)& FranklinCovey (FC).

I held ITT before the Hilton takeover bid, I am happy to say, but unfortunately
sold before the really big score, when Starwood bought the Sheraton hotels. A
Value Investor interviewed in Kiplingers says HOT is worth $45-65/share.
Thoughts on this are welcome.

FranklinCovey...I do not know what to make of this one. Some analyst quoted in
Worth a few times recommended FC when it was in the mid 20's. I happened to
look at it for 1st time in months...stock is now around 13.

The "Seven Habits" company is currently trading at 7x earnings!

I suspect there are a few people out there who bought well into the 20's after
doing classic Peter Lynch-style analysis (attending a FC seminar [I have and
thought it was excellent]); own, use and benefit from a Franklin Planner (as I
do), only to see stock in the dumper. Further exacerbating things is the fact
that FC has bought back a lot of shares in the high teens and 20's, not a good
investment thus far. Thoughts on HOT & FC appreciated. Cheers

Jim, could you speculate as to why NH is materially weaker than DE, AG, and
CSE? It has much higher yield, lower price to book, less exposure to North
America, the huge Fiat buyback program (if active), etc? It is starting to sell
where it would if the dividend were not there, whereas if the analysts are not
all wet on earnings the dividend should be maintained. (I nibbled again under 9

<<Jim, could you speculate as to why NH is materially weaker than DE, AG, and

America, the huge Fiat buyback program (if active), etc?>>
This same thing is happening in industry after industry after industry. The
large cap industry leader is hanging in there while the smaller companies'
shares are just getting thrown in the trash. A couple things about NH are very
interesting - first, this is no tiny company - New Holland is significantly
bigger than Deere in Europe and Latin America. New Holland's balance sheet is
more than strong enough to ride out a recession.

Two points I would make:
1) This is a classic example of a market inefficiency. Portfolio managers with
a one quarter time horizon will just dump things like New Holland. There is no
reason it can't go lower. But the secret of value investing is to buy what
nobody else wants. Before you play this game, though, just ask yourself whether
or not you are willing to hold NH for 3-5 years if that's how long it takes for
the ag sector to turn around. I don't think it will take that long, but it
could. I can say with some confidence its not going to be this year.
2) A 6% yield makes the wait much more palatable. Will the dividend be cut? I
don't think so. The company has the balance sheet to pay the dividend, and
remember that Fiat which owns 70% of the company wants that cash flow and
controls the board.

Do your homework, but if you aren't finding any explanation for the price, I'll
just tell you I don't think you're missing anything and I have been following
this company closely for two years as an institutional investor. I know
management and these are honest, conservative people who are every bit as
baffled as we are at the stock price. I averaged down at a little above 10 and
will again when I can scrape two nickels together. Just remember that in this
game we could be completely right about the future return and the stock could
still go to 5.

Jim, thanks for your view on NH. I would say that there is no way that a
company this large will go to $5 (double the yield on Treasuries) unless the
yield on Treasuries zooms (which I think is extremely improbable considering
the lack of any worldwide inflationary excess)
or the strong PERCEPTION develops that the dividend will be cut (which is
conceivable).

My own opinion is that there is a temporary excess of institutional supply from
one type of institution who bought it between 15 and 30 and are giving up and
not enough demand yet from the value, income oriented investor. The stock took
200,000 shares in two blocks in the morning at $9 1/4 but couldn't handle
100,000 in the afternoon without giving ground.

I am curious about the status/activity of the huge Fiat buyback which could
have retired half the public stock, if I remember correctly. I wonder if they
could be the buyer of these large blocks, and because of time zone differences
not in the market in the PM? I do not have much experience on that kind of
thing.

I'll take that. Everything you ever wanted to know about NH and were afraid to
ask:

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/990127/pa_new_hol_8.html

I think it reads rather well (except I think they may be too optimistic about
Brazil for 1999). Book value is $12 and cash is $4.50. But note a good amount
of debt, so discount the cash. The average of 7 analyst estimates is $1.36 for
1999, and $1.69 for 2000, with plenty of time since the last release for
adjustment.

The company would have to do more than $1 worse per share than estimates over
the next two years for maintenance of the $.55 dividend to have ANY effect on
cash or book value. The company has earnings power of $3 per share in good
times.

I think 75% of book, a yield of 6.45% at 8 15/16 (after giving effect
to $.41 of the $.55 dividend accrued to date), is ludicrous unless
the company is going to start losing lots of money and be at real risk of
cutting the dividend. In other words, that is what the current price is
starting to discount.

I would add that with parent company and majority shareholder Fiat, the company
may be somewhat protected from the "going out of business"
risk that can become a factor in the pricing of some cyclical stocks during
hard times. I do not believe that the stock should sell for less than about $6,
even if they cut out the dividend and start losing $1 per share or so, giving
me a worst case scenario of minus 3 points,
versus eventual recovery potential of 15 points or more. I will take 5 to 1
reward/risk on a big company any time I can get it, particularly with that
large dividend. In fact, I believe that at this price NH is a superior
investment to Treasury bonds.

If analyst estimates are hit, with a recovery commencing in 2000, the stock is
a potential double in 18 months. In fact, even if analyst estimates aren't hit,
IF a recovery starts in 2000, I believe the price would still exceed $15 in 18
months.

Three persistent drags on NH price might be:

1. Negative surprise for 4q98
2. Small float/Fiat Control. (As in, "Who are they working for, Fiat or all
shareholders?")
3. Lack of trasparency, or access to complete financial info in the usual
places--they aren't in Value Line and the "profile" in Yahoo is incomplete.
Makes it hard for them to get past the first screen.

A final, perhaps temporary, effect is their relatively higher exposure
internationally.

Just some thoughts.

On your last point, a higher exposure internationally is a plus not a minus.
First, based on their release North America in 1999 will be the weakest area
for the market relative to 1998. Second, I would think the US market is largely
replacement, while any true growth will eventually come from overseas.

Your other points probably have helped us to buy the stock at 6-8% below the
prior low, whereas DE, CSE, and AG average 17% above the lows previously
reached at the same time. I do not believe NH fundamentals are worse and they
may be better. Certainly the yield is a far superior investment factor compared
with the other three.

Re: NH and Fiat,

This had crossed my mind as well. Wasn't Fiat buying back shares of NH last
fall (and possibly supporting a price)? Does anybody know their strategic
objectives or could we be susceptible to a "take-under"?

Sorry for not having the answers but that was a concern when I recently bought
at what I thought was a rock-bottom price of $9.5! As long as the dividend is
secure then I have no fear adding to it. Let's just hope Fiat likes the
dividend income as much as I do!

Good investing,

Hi Wallace,

Re: TECD; I followed them until recently but I didn't own them. I had bought a
competitor named Ingram Micro and managed to make some money on them as they
expanded but sold when I thought their debt level was getting out of hand. TECD
has less debt but missed an earnings report last fall and was taken out and
shot. The electronics/technology distribution market has been on decline since.
Many are afraid that the internet and direct distribution will continue to harm
them so it seems they are trying to be the value-added distribution channel
which basically means assembly. Margins are also crummy.

I still track them out of habit. I don't see anything compelling but as Paul

that! Maybe soon I'll do a quarterly track of the threads' picks to prove it!

there's some big ugly chunk of bad news that's pushing this down that we don't

If there is such a thing, it would be company specific since the relative
underperformance of NH verses comparables is substantial. I did an overlay
tacking the prices together 3 months ago. Over a 3 month period DEERE would
have outperformed by 50%, AGCO by 26%, and Case by 33% [Dividends, if any, not

it's occurring.

NH - I read the report and felt it to be overly optimistic on projected sales.
The global Ag economy is in terrible shape. Ag equipment dealers are hurting,
some farmers are in trouble, none of them are talking new equipment. The prices
appear to have bottomed, but there's no sign of improvement. World currency
devaluations, tighter bank credit policies, etc. With another large crop in
1999, the situation could get worse.

I listen to Ag news every morning as I have some farmland I lease out on
percentage. Last year we had the best yield we've ever had with poor profits -
but at least we had profits. Low prices, high fertilizer, & chemical costs, new
EPA restrictions, etc. Last week I talked with a local Ag equipment dealer. His
shop is busy but he's selling no equipment - particularly new. The NH dealer
usually has a good turnover, but the same machines have been sitting on his lot
since last Spring (I drive by it every day)

Deere & Case are relying heavily on their construction equipment divisions to
offset poor Ag sales. They have been and hope to benefit from the strong home
and business construction that now seems to be weakening. NH has little to no
marketing in this area.

FWIW,

On NH, I do not have a company specific fundamental reason. However, if you
look at the blocks there have been 2 adding up to about 200,000 shares at 9
1/4, and one for 50,000 at 9, plus a bunch of other small ones. If an
institution wanted to get out and had 500,000 share to sell, that would account
for the trading. But then in a month from now the stock should have recovered.
Therefore, if it does then that is probably the explanation; if it does not
then there may be something else.

If there was something catastrophic, I think the end of January release would
not have read the way it did, and the recent dividend declaration would have
been used as an opportunity to revise expectations.

Investment Highlights:
&#183; After delaying releasing results, the company
announced an extensive restatement, reducing
1998 earnings from what would have been a
profit of $0.86 to a loss of $0.18.
&#183; We think there could be some near-term
weakness based on these developments.
&#183; Despite the earnings surprise, Orbital's
fundamentals remain very strong, in our view.
We continue to value the business at $55 by
yearend 1999.
&#183; Company currently trading at only on 13.4x
our est. EPS for Infrastructure division alone.
&#183; We are maintaining our Buy ratings.
Fundamental Highlights:
&#183; Without accounting changes, company would
have posted profit of $0.23 for Q4, ahead of
our $0.20 estimate, and an annual profit of
$0.86 versus our estimate of $0.82.

Orbital Sciences Corp – 18 February 1999
2
Company Posts an Earnings
Disappointment, But Fundamentals
Remain Strong
Orbital announced 1998 results that surprised investors.
EPS for the year came in at a loss of $0.18 per share. This
compares to consensus estimates of a profit of $0.67 as of
February 10, prior to the announcement of any accounting
charges and consensus estimates of a profit of $0.58 on
February 12 after the company announced there would be
accounting charges.
The stock could be weak on this news, however, we are
maintaining our Buy ratings. The company's
fundamentals remain sound, in our view.
Additional Accounting Charges
Our previous notes outlined planned accounting charges of
$5M at MacDonald Dettwiler due to a contract extension
and $6.5 M at Magellan due to a change in accounting
policy writing off product development. The company
announced these Wednesday, February 3. At the same
time, the company postponed their earnings release until
yesterday.
Yesterday the company announced total after-tax charges
for 1998 of $1.04 per share. These came from three
sources: 1) An after-tax charge of $18.8 M from contract
adjustments in the Infrastructure division, similar to those
at MacDonald Dettwiler, that resulted from re-amortization
of profits over longer contract periods as a result of
contract extensions. 2) An after-tax charge of $6.93 M
derived from the prior $6.5 M of product write-offs plus
additional inventory reserves of $4 M at Magellan related
to potentially obsolete products. 3) An after-tax charge of
$9.8 M due to changes at ORBCOMM in the recognition
of up-front license fees on international franchise
agreements.
Without these charges, EPS would have been $0.23 for the
quarter and $0.86 for the year. This compares to our
estimates of$0.20 for the quarter and $0.82 for the year,
prior to making adjustments on February 3. With the
adjustments, EPS came in at a loss of $0.53 for Q4 and a
loss of $0.18 for the year.
Division Results
Infrastructure EPS posted EPS for the year at $1.41.
Without adjustments, it would have been $1.91 compared
to our estimate of $1.89.
Access Products EPS posted EPS for the year at a loss of
$0.44. Without adjustments, it would have been a loss of
$0.23 compared to our estimate of a loss of $0.20.
Satellite Services EPS posted EPS for the year at at a loss
of $1.14. Without adjustments, it would have been a loss
of $0.80 compared to our estimate of $0.94.
Detail on consolidated results before and after the charges
appears in a table below.
Upcoming Quarters Should
Restore Confidence
We expect the upcoming quarters. to show strength. As
these results become clear investors should develop
restored confidence.
But the Stock Appears
Undervalued
We recently raised our estimate of EPS for the
Infrastructure division to $2.17 per share for 1999. The
entire company is currently trading at only 13.4x the
earnings for this division alone. We value this division at
$37 per share. We continue to value ORBCOMM and
ORBIMAGE at a combined value of more than $18 per
share. All indications suggest these businesses should
maintain consistent development during 1999. Our
yearend 1999 valuation remains $55, based on a sum-of-the-
parts. Accordingly, we maintain our Buy ratings.
Fundamentals Remain Strong
Revenue growth and margins in the Infrastructure business
remain robust. ORBCOMM terminal growth appears on
track. We understand ORBCOMM terminals finished
1998 with 32,000 terminals. As of 2/1 ORBCOMM
terminals ordered total 45,000, with 37,000 sold to
customers. This rate would put the company on track to
exceed 200,000 units by yearend. Only slight acceleration
would be needed to reach the company's 250,000 terminal
yearend target.

I wonder if anyone has pursued the WEB investment style through Weitz.
I am new here, so forgive me if I repeat what may have been discussed before.
(Kindly steer me to it)

I saw Wallace Weitz on Ruckeyser on October 9 and liked what he said, a lot.
However, I live in Hong Kong most of the time and somehow could not find the
address of his funds (spelling problem?). Bought the Ruckeyser transcript for
$5 (it may be on his website now) and wrote for material. No response. I think
they can only sell to US residents even if citizens and therefore taxpayers
abroad. Well, I phoned, learned how it works (now waiting for the material
being forwarded by the Florida Post Office)

Weitz on Ruckeyser, on Oct 9 mentioned Hilton being at depreciated book (The
Waldorf Astoria ?!) and lo! it went from 14 to 22. My kind of guy.

So, I downloaded, more or less at random an SEC (EDGAR Form pick) doc

http://edgar.sec.gov/edaux/formlynx.htm Type in “Weitz”

02-26-1999 485APOS 910031 WEITZ PARTNERS INC

from which I quote:

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES/GOALS

The Fund's primary investment objective is capital appreciation. The Fund seeks
to achieve its objective by investing primarily in common stocks and a variety
of securities convertible into common stocks such as rights, warrants,
convertible preferred stock and convertible bonds. The Fund may also invest in
other securities of a company not convertible into common stock, such as bonds
and preferred stock, which Wallace R. Weitz & Company ("Weitz & Co."), the
Fund's investment adviser, determines may offer the opportunity for capital
appreciation. Such securities may be investment grade, non-investment grade or
unrated. The Fund considers long-term capital gains preferable to short-term
capital gains and dividend and interest income, but all such gains and income
are desirable.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES

The Fund's investment strategy (which is called "value investing") is to invest
primarily in the common stocks of sound, growing, well-managed businesses. In
implementing this strategy Weitz & Co. attempts to:

- - Identify attractive businesses that Weitz & Co. understands and which have
honest, competent management;

- - Estimate the price that an informed, rational buyer would pay for 100% of
that business; and then

- - Buy securities of that business if they are available at a significant
discount to this "business value" or "private market value".

At the heart of the calculation of value is an estimate of the value today of
the right to receive all of the cash that a business will generate for its
owners in the future. The valuation may focus on asset values, earning power,
the intangible value of a company's "franchise" in its market or a combination
of these variables, depending on the nature of the business. Weitz & Co. then
tries to buy shares of the company's stock at a significant discount to this
"private market value." Weitz & Co. hopes that the stock price will rise as the
value of the business grows and as the valuation discount narrows. However,
even if the analysis of business value is correct, the stock price may fail to
reflect this value.

Weitz & Co. does not try to "time" the market, but if there is cash
available for investment and there are not stocks which meet the Fund's
investment criteria or if Weitz & Co. determines market conditions warrant, the
Fund will hold cash or invest in high quality fixed income securities for
temporary defensive purposes.

End of Quote. Exactly my philosophy. Couldn't put it better.

Mind you, the minimum investment is $ 100 000 (other Weitz funds apparently $
25 000) but I trust we don't only have kids on this thread.

Ruckeyser said Weitz has $ 1.8 Billion under management. Lives in Omaha, of
course.

Well, this is pure Warren Buffet and I wonder what the value investors on this
thread may say. It seems to me it is worth the 1.25 % fee, but of course it
reduces the fun of looking and discussing. Mind you, I find it awfully hard and
frustrating to find anything at a price “with a margin for error” these days

Regarding my own way of thinking, a sample on the LVCI thread

http://www3.techstocks.com/~wsapi/investor/reply-8136632

I had met the inventor of the laser correction of shortsightedness, Dr.
L'Esperance at Hogmanay (sp?) in Scotland, New Year's of 1995. The machines ($
400 000 ea) are produced by VISX. I bought VISX in 1995 at $ 12, it got a
better CEO and now is past $ 160 (i.e. 80 after a split)

Laser Vision Centers Inc (LVCI) basically own a lot of trailers with those
machines and go around the country fixing eyes. They have a patent about
suspending the machines so they don't go out of adjustment.

So, the post is about the relative merits.

L'Esperance found a laser that has an energy of 6.2 electron volts per
photon. The lens molecule takes 5.9 ev to destroy. So, with a computer you can
correct the lens most accurately.

I looked for any posts on Weitz, a WEB type fund manager, after he appeared on
Ruckeyser on October 9. The posts numbered 5100 and up, of that period, seem to
have ignored that interview.

Is it possible that nobody noticed ?
