Probably the best way to get an idea of what I am interested in is to read my
profile including the posts that are listed.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/profile.aspx?userid=4202223

FWIW, I have been a net seller in 2006 with net gains in ARDI, FWD and some
others I have mentioned on this thread. I am more interested in small cap
rather than large cap. I also should also say that I don't always invest in
value stocks and some of the companies that I am currently most interested in
are biotechs which certainly wouldn't fit into the parameters of what is
considered value. But I like the patent protection that med-tech/biotech
companies offer and I am willing to accept the risks involved with investing in
this sector.

Paul,I think PWE was just written up in forbes or forbes on line. I did the
same thing with HGT. was waiting for it to drop to a certain price and it never
got there. I assume it may also benefit from the notion that the fed is almost
done raising rates. Any way seems like a low risk dividend cap preservation

IR and LLL -
Bought some IR as well. Stock is near it's 52 weeks low, low valuation (PE
around 10) and boosting guidance. While it may be true that housing may be
going down, only a part of IR products(the highly profitable Bobcat's) are
related to residential housing. Many of IR products are used for commercial and
infrastructure ,which has not much to do with housing, or is completely
unrelated (Thermo King). I think IR's earnings quality is pretty decent, with a
good chunk of earnings being converted to FCF (Capex is lower than
deprecation).

LLL - the electronics/defense company is also trading near it's 52 weeks low.
Valuation metrics are on par of lower than most other defense peers but i think
that LLL is better positioned(and has been faster growing) than most. The death
of the founder is considered a setback but also may make LLL a takeover play.

Oln - Just awarded a big fat option and cash bonus to upper management. Not
sure about the rest of the value crowd, but it would seem that most upper
management in these organizations is overpaid as is. Options should be for the
rank and file and let overpaid upper management buy there stock when they think
it is a value. The blatant chronyism existent between the BOD and the officers
for many of the larger companies seems like a breech of responsibility to me.

Also, OLN just refinanced debt. Seems like it was a good deal for the bond

If you believe that you consistently can achieve 30% returns per annum for
extended periods of time, you live in la-la land. It's unfortunate, since some
of the principles you talk about are good.

And please stop selling the returns of your "friend" that are impossible to

OLN. I'll hold my few shares, because I like the low p/sales number, and
there's the dividend.

The company's businesses are cyclical -- note the erratic profitability and roe
in the profitable years. And they have cut that dividend before.

I'm not willing now to add to my position.

My guess - for me, diversified as I am, and holding only a few shares of OLN,
I'm okay with trying to hang on for a few more quarters. For anybody else -
somebody with a concentrated stock portfolio who's looking for a value stock
(and not a trading bounce in the stock price), I'd look for better places to
put money than on OLN.

Needless to say, Jurgis, if you cannot believe that I, or anyone else who uses
the Investment Strategy as originally formulated by my friend, Dr.Karl Posel,
can achieve 30% per annum for extended periods of time, then that's your
opinion and you're entitled to it.

Unfortunately it's only your "belief" and "opinion" because you have arrived at
it with little or no idea as to what the strategy or its criteria consists of.
There are others on this Board who have made the same assertions as you have,
based on the same paucity of relevant information.

Surely if one is going to attack the integrity, or otherwise, of someone, the
least one should have done was to have studied the relevant information and
drawn logical conclusions.
Seeing as you don't have that "relevant information", I find it difficult to
attach much credence to your remarks in this regard.

I'm afraid I have no idea what you are referring to in your comments, "stop
selling the returns of your "friend"", and "doubtful quality professional
service advertising".
Apart from giving details of my contact e-mail address (which, I believe, is
permitted), I'm certainly not aware of having done any "selling" or
"advertising" on "Value Investing" !
Maybe you can elaborate.

If there's anything you feel the need to "report to SI admin" about, then by
all means do so. I cannot but abide by the ruling of the Administrators of this

Hi Madharry - Good work on your "SIL" position. It made my top five list today
up more than 4.38%. The shipping stocks have been hot too (the last 10 days).
DRYS was up over 4.58% today and up 44% from my last buy at $9.00 in June. I am
still under water with my other shares but it finally turned the corner so it
does not hurt as much.

SFL is another one that has had a good run too. It also pays an excellent
dividend. As the shipping day rate continue to rise, all these shipping
companies are finally making good money.

I own AU which is a top producer in gold. I sold some Jan $60 covered calls
today as I was able to get $2.30 for each contract. My last buy on these shares
was around $35, so it's time to take a little off the table.

I continue to like BHP long term and feel that many of these natural resource
companies are good "long term" value plays. If the dollar falls and inflation
picks up, these natural resource companies hold their value. That why I like
ConocoPhillips. It's on my watch list and on any pull back (maybe in the $60
range) I will start a new position.

Im very much underwater with SIL as I've ridden this from the mid -teens up in
the twenties increasing my position then selling a chunk off around 18 after
the bolivian natural gas nationalization and then increasing my position in the
14s and 15s mostly. I will accept kudos on this one when and if it gets into
the 20s. I increased my position initially in the 20s because the company's
projections were so compelling, and they continue to be. Oddly enough, my price
targets for the company are not particularly leveraged to the price of silver
or zinc, as they project to be such a low cost producer. Im pretty surprised
there has not been some hostile take over attempt.

With respect to energy I think that the small producers will outshine the
integrated producers percentage wise so most of my energy focus is in that
area. Unfortunately many of them trade in small quanitities on foreign
exchanges or the otc bb. VPC.V looked like a great opportunity and I made well
over 50% on it and was looking for a lot more and then it was acquired by its
swedish parent company. You made a good call on DRYS. congrats.

COP - you are way off with your FCF calculation
 excellent free flow cash flow ($12.38/share per year) 

In fact COP has very little FCF relative to earnings, as most cash flow is
plowed back into operations. For example for Q1, COP has put 4.51B$ in Capex,
which after subtracting 1.24B$ in depreciation means 3.27B$ in net investment,
about equal with net income after taxes. This means that FCF for this quarter
was essentially nil.

I don't follow COP directly, but I still hold a closed-end energy/materials

Although I hold these, I probably would not invest additional funds at this
point in time, since short term oil may even drop to $50 or lower, even if the
longer term price is likely to reach >$100. Like Buffett has said, easy gains
in this sector have been made. From here on, there will be a lot of political
issues including nationalization of foreign oil fields, etc. So, I would say:
step lightly. :)

Dynasil Announces Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 Results

August 04, 2006 11:26:37 (ET)

WEST BERLIN, N.J., Aug 04, 2006 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Dynasil Corporation of
America (DYSL, Trade), fabricator of optical blanks from synthetic fused
silica, fused quartz, and other optical materials for the semi-conductor,
laser, space and optical components industries, and through its subsidiary,
Optometrics Corporation, a worldwide supplier of optical components including
diffraction gratings, thin film filters, laser optics, monochromators, and
specialized optical systems, announced results of operations for the 3rd
quarter ended June 30, 2006.

This is the fifth full quarter of results after the combination of Optometrics
with Dynasil. As previously announced, the acquisition of the assets of
Optometrics LLC was completed on March 8, 2005.

Revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 were $1,833,869, an increase of
13% over revenues of $1,619,128 for the quarter ended June 30, 2005. The net
profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 was $139,591, or $.03 per share,
compared with a net profit of $56,134, or $.01 per share, for the quarter ended
June 30, 2005. Revenue growth in both business units and strong manufacturing
efficiencies were the largest drivers of the profitability gains.

Revenues for the 9 months ended June 30, 2006 were $5,047,405, an increase of
44% over revenues of $3,497,340 for the 9 months ended June 30, 2005. The net
profit for the 9 months ended June 30, 2006 was $246,896, or $0.05 per share,
compared with a net profit of $74,885, or $0.02 per share, for the 9 months
ended June 30, 2005. The addition of Optometrics for the full year was the
largest driver for the revenue and profitability gains.

"I am pleased with the strong results for the quarter and the significant
profitability increase over our last year," said Craig T. Dunham, President and
CEO. "The addition of Optometrics has had a major positive impact on Dynasil
and we are implementing progressive cost reductions and process improvements
which have increased profitability. We continue to focus on our strategy of
profitable growth from our optical components businesses and by pursuing
acquisitions and strategic alliances."

Thanx for the Report on DYSL, Lazarus.
I'm not exactly sure why you've sent it to me. Have we discussed this company
in the past ? I'll assume you've sent it to me for comment.

My initial comment regarding DYSL is that it's a fairly small company at this
stage. There have been some improvements in its numbers, especially with regard
to Turnover.
However, personally, I don't like the level of Long Term Debt on its Balance
Sheet. This is currently adding an expense which is the equivalent of 15.5% of
its Bottom Line.
In addition, I'd also like to see a greater return on Capital.

But being a smallish company, some of the critical ratios may be more
exaggerated. So if it was me, I'd be keeping an eye on its future results in
order to confirm that there was continuing improvement.

Hi LauA. First of all it's Karl Posel, not Postel. I'm sure it was an
unintentional slip on your part.

Secondly, you and others have adopted a rather simplistic and unsubstantiated
assumption regarding the raison d'etre behind the motivation to achieve a
Capital Gain of +/- 40% per annum.
Yes, 1.40 to the power of 18 results in a factor of about 427. Which, by the
way, doesn't make you billionaire after 18 years if you had started with $1
million. You'd need between 20 and 21 years to achieve that "status".

What you're obviously not aware of (and how could you be) is the fact that
Dr.Posel's clients were all retired folk, generally well into their 60's. They
needed an Income now, not in 18 or 20 years time. Therefore the Capital gain
per annum was turned into a regular annual Income by selling off a certain
percentage of their stock and using this Revenue to obtain short term Voluntary
Purchased Annuities (VPA).

During the life span of these Annuites, the Client obtains a return equivalent
to a regular income. At the end of the life of the Annuity, say 5 years, the
original Capital sum invested in the VPA is reduced to zero. However, the
balance of the Capital gain, not invested in the Annuity is, in the meantime,
increasing in value on the stock market, at a rate equivalent to about 40% per
annum. After the 5 year period a portion of this Capital Gain is once again
used to purchase another VPA, and the cycle repeats itself, providing the
Client with an ongoing Income.

In my own case, I've also sold off certain percentages of my stocks that had
earned an average of 30% to 40% per annum, and used the proceeds to purchase
sectional title property, which then provide a regular monthly rental income.
After all, the only time you earn "hard cash" from your shares is when you sell
them or they provide a dividend.

Jurgis Bekepuris, I really don’t intend getting into a "slanging match" with
you regarding what I earn, or don’t earn, with my investments on the stock
market.

Why you, and several others, find it so hard to believe that it’s possible to
earn in the order of 30% to 40%/annum, on a regular basis, on the stock market
is really beyond me !
Maybe you have your doubts because your regular annual returns have been far
less than what I, Dr.Posel and several of my clients have achieved in the past.
If that is the case, then you may want to re-evaluate the criteria upon which
you base your stock analysis.

I find it strange that you, and several others, have been prepared to spend so
much time with "my case" of "40% per annum", bearing in mind that, on another
Board, we have someone who apparently achieves Returns of 50% per annum !!
In fact, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if, in the future, he achieved in
excess of 50% per annum, were he to remove some of the poorer performing stock
from his portfolio and put a greater investment into the better quality ones.

If you don’t like what I write, or regard that what I say is in any way
unacceptable, then why don’t you just do what several other Board members have
done and put me on "Ignore". Surely that would relieve you of this apparently
terrible "burden" of exposure to my posts. Rest assured, I certainly won’t take
any offence should you take that course of action.

Judging by the numerous constructive PM’s and e-mails I’ve received from other
"Value Investing" Board members, it’s become apparent to me that you, and Carl
Worth, and several others do not represent the opinions of each and every
individual Board member.
A very good, verbatim, example in this regard is the following ....

"To this end, I'm curious as to how you define "value" and I'd like to learn
your "process". Mind you, while I did have you on "ignore", I won't in the
future.
By the way, I'm a fairly "young" value investor, myself. I started reading
Graham and another value investor recommended a few books about Buffett. I'd
love to see you contribute to the thread."

Therefore I see no reason, whatsoever, to deviate in any way from how I conduct
myself on "Value Investing".

i think it is quite telling that you end posts regarding me with Q.E.D. at
times, but then you need to bring my name into things again...even your word
that you will leave such things be cannot be trusted...in any event, let's look
at your latest diatribe, shall we?

once again you bring dale baker into the discussion, and once again you wildly
distort his thesis...he is not saying he will make 50% a year, that is not what
"50% gains investing" means...he is saying that he is looking for ideas that
have the potential to gain 50%...note also that his thread has existed for
years and years, and in that time, his approach has changed quite a bit, from
being much more aggressive, and having results that were much more volatile, to
having a more diversified portfolio which achieves gradual gains with less
significant drawdowns...of course you have no idea on such things, as you
randomly jumped into his thread a year ago and promptly got yourself banned
(actually banned twice, you still hold the record on his thread for
that...LOL), and of course you don't bother to check the history of the thread,
to understand it, you just carry this personal vendetta against dale for the
rest of your life

note that dale's gains are on trades which are posted in real time, EVERY
SINGLE TRADE as they happen, not oh i bought this back some other time and look
it has gone up 78%, and oh i never have a losing trade, and oh i make 30/40/50%
a year EVERY year and then, comedy of all comedies, i look at the balance sheet
of a fairly straight forward, well known company, and can't even understand it

i would say that you should give up on bashing dale while you are wildly
behind, and stop making it even worse, but i know you aren't likely to take
that constructive advice either

going off on some wild tangent about VPA's and people who need income, wherein
you just throw in the 40% per annum gains as if they are a matter of fact,
doesn't make them any more factual than the rest of your ramblings

i do find your supposed verbatim PM interesting, since your profile appears to
show even more people have now ignored you, while less have you
bookmarked...it's also interesting that the supposed PM uses "quotes" around
words in the same way that you do, but i'm sure we can take your word for the
legitimacy of that PM, since you have always proven to be so forthcoming in the
past...LOL (oops, i LOL'd, i know how you love that)...by the way, how would
this person sending you a PM know that you are young? i mean other than the
fact that you act infantile, when did you state on this thread that you are of
a certain age or age range? and why do none of these supposed fans of yours
post publicly? please don't tell me it's because they fear me or jurgis or any
of the others who see through your nonsense...plenty of people have seen fit to
debate me and others quite publicly here, so it would be quite absurd to think
that they would all shy away from doing so on this one issue...besides, i doubt
it would incite any debate to simply say that someone thinks your stock
selection process has merit, except that you never give us any clue as to how
your magical black box works, or the ideas it generates, except in vagaries and
hindsight claims of outsized gains, so what could they base that on anyway?

i suppose this post is not cordial and constructive, or whatever terms you used
previously, but then again, i'm not the one who made claims (lies) about being
that either, am i?

LOL

though it is quite preliminary, i think this is of interest:

stocks you assessed as favored on 7/6:

HANS
IPS
ANST
AOB

average return of those positions since:

-5% (since you like to annualize so much, that annualizes to near bankruptcy)

again, one month does not a year make, but since you don't post actual buys or
sells, any inference as to your REAL performance can only be made from such
data

oh well, i'm sure you will let us know that you sold HANS at its absolute high
and put it all into whatever stock has gone up 50% since...(yawn)

Mr. Worth, there's no doubt, in my mind, that you're a "Master" at twisting
words and making insinuations to suit your own purposes. I can only hope this
is as evident to other discerning Board Members as it is to myself.

I don't intend entering into a long discussion with you, in line with my
previous "Q.E.D.'s".
However, with regard to Dale Baker, you are completely off the mark.

I have no "personal vendetta" against him, nor, to the best of my knowledge,
have I ever done any "bashing".
If his "50% Gains Investing" doesn't mean that he targets a 50% gain per annum,
then fine, maybe I'm not correct in that regard. Based on how he reports his
Monthly statistics I assumed that was his target.

However, from what I've seen of the Portfolio's previous results, he seems to
make an Annual Capital Gain that approaches, or exceeds, the percentages I've
referred to. Unlike others on this Board, I'm not surprised at the magnitude of
those achievable Annual gains.

My only general comment I've made with regard to his strategy was to do with
the size of his portfolio, which may include "lesser quality" companies which
could detract from the performance of the "better quality companies", and
thereby bring down the average performance of his Portfolio.
Notwithstanding that, I see Dale Baker as an astute and well informed Investor
who puts the principles of Fundamental Analysis to good use.

Unfortunately your bitter "word twisting and insinuation" strategy has
incorporated the above into your own personal vendetta against bruwin. But as
you, yourself, write .... (yawn).

Keith, below is an extract from HANS's 8-K SEC Filing published in the last day
or two.
If anyone wishes to still sell their HANS shares after what it contains, then I
suggest they seriously consider brushing up on the more relevant aspects of
Fundamental Analysis.

This, in fact, is why I prefer not to "punt" stocks. It often happens that one
sees temporary sell-offs in Quality stocks, for, who knows, what reasons. It's
happened to me, that the price of a stock that I recommended fell due to a
temporary sell-off, and I was then "accused" of giving "bad advice" !!

I suspect that these short term sell offs, quite often have to do with short
sellers, who realise the inherent quality of a company and use their relatively
"deep pockets" to influence the stock's price downwards in the short term,
knowing full well that they'll profit at a later date when they buy back prior
to that stock's inevitable medium to longer term price rise.

Were you to visit my web site you'd see 3 examples of this occurrence. DAW, DGC
and WBO (3 S.African companies) increased by 154% in 9 mths, 114% in 6 mths and
96% in 12 mths. respectively. Yet each of those shares had several short term
sell offs in their medium to long term upward climb. And they only had an
upward climb due to their excellent Fundamentals. So one has to ask the
question, "Why, and Who sold stock that could have provided them with
exceptional Capital Gains ??!!"

As a matter of interest, when I first entered DGC on my web site about 2 years
ago, it was trading at 70c. It closed on Friday at 310c. That's a Capital Gain
of over 340%, or 170%/annum.
It's one of the few S.African stocks that Dr.Posel and I are currently prepared
to own. And we'll continue to own it just as long as it continues to satisfy
our criteria.

Anyway, here's that report. I hope it, and what I said above, answers your
question ....

Decided I'll up my very few shares of oil tanker stock, General Maritime, GMR.

I've not done well with this one, having started an exploratory purchase last
year @ $46.81 and selling some shares as the stock dropped. Now @$37.50...after
the stock has moved up from lows, I'll add back just a few shares (at prices
higher than I sold at). This after re-looking at the stock based on a favorable
fund manager's comment on Bloomberg Friday.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=GMR&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

The positives seem to be:
a modern fleet
shareholder emphasis with buybacks and dividends
emphasis on strong balance sheet (no net debt)

Not happy to come to the conclusion that maybe I've been late to add and that I
maybe should not have been selling. These errors happen sometimes though due to
combination of sloth and risk with a highly diversified portfolio. The risk of
not following and/or understanding a position carefully enough because it is so
small and tucked in amongst many, many other stocks.

And even now, still just a very small exploratory position for me.

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ?

I was really hoping that we’d put this topic to bed, especially after I’d said
as much in my Message 24537.
However, considering the content of Jurgis’s ‘ANNOUNCEMENT’, I feel obliged to
respond, seeing, amongst other things, that there’s very little doubt that I’m
"the said person" he’s referring to.

Apart from his contention that "consistent 30-40% annualised returns have not
been achieved in the investment history", he has ignored and/or overlooked two
important aspects ...

(1) He has no knowledge of the contents or actual modus operandi of the
investment strategy that we use. Yet he’s prepared to pronounce it incapable of
producing consistent annual returns of 30% or more.
(2) There are several major differences in the stock selection and stock
analysis strategy that we use when compared to what is generally used by other
investors who utilise the principles of Fundamental Analysis.

Item (1) is, I believe, self evident so I won’t bore the reader any more than I
have to !

However, item (2), I believe, requires more elaboration.

Yes, there may be some truth in Jurgis’s contention that "consistent 30-40%
annualised returns have not been achieved in the investment history", and if
that were the case, it wouldn’t surprise me, based on the investments strategy
that the vast majority of folk tend to use. Because the vast majority, most
especially Fund & Portfolio Managers, use the "multi-stock" portfolio approach,
which can contain dozens and dozens of stocks.

It stands to reason that there will be very good performers amongst that list,
but there will also be poorer performers as well. I suggest that, if you’re
lucky, maybe 10% or 15% of a large stock portfolio will give you exceptional
Capital Gain of, say, 80% per annum. For the rest you may only average about
10% Capital Gain, if Jurgis’s prediction of an investor getting 15% is one who
"will be very successful" !!
In fact, based on a REALLY successful investor (according to Jurgis), we’d have
:-

(80% x 15% of stocks) + (10% x 85% of stocks) = 20% Capital Gain, > 15%.

So as you can see, to satisfy Jurgis’s contention that earning 15%/annum,
consistently, is about the best average you can expect, it appears that the
vast majority of one’s multi-stock portfolio will return a modest annual
Capital gain of +/- 10%.
Needless to say, you may not entirely agree with the "weighting" of my
percentages, but the principle remains.

So why not, then, concentrate more of your efforts on the better Quality Stocks
that indicate, via CLEARLY DEFINABLE criteria within their Financial
Statements, that they are producing excellent ongoing profits and are providing
excellent, ongoing value for their shareholders ?

And this, to a large extent, is what the 3-part Investment Strategy of my good
friend, Dr,Posel, manages to achieve. Rest assured, only a relative handful of
Industrial type companies will SIMULTANEOUSLY meet or exceed ALL of the
stringent criteria. But those that do, are doing so for very good reason, which
is why one can expect, and receive, above average Capital Gain, which will not
be diluted by less exceptional stocks.

There will be those that will argue that holding only a few stocks is "risky".
What happens if they fall through the floor ?
Well, exceptional companies, performing exceptionally well, tend to be managed
by exceptional management, otherwise they’d hardly be making the profits they
were making. And exceptional management tend to also manage for the unexpected
and tend to be familiar with the principle of "contingency plans".

And by "CLEARLY DEFINABLE criteria" we don’t refer to ratios such as P/S, P/BK,
P/CF etc ... (except P/E where we suggest you take E/O Items and once-off tax
credits into account). By all means, it’s your choice to use them, but in our
opinion you’ll get relatively minimal benefit from them. To really get an
insight into how a company is performing, we believe you’ve got to dig deep
into the "engine room" of an Income Statement and Balance Sheet in order to,
firstly select, and secondly to determine whether or not an Industrial company
is "firing on ALL Financial cylinders !!"

Contrary to Paul Senior’s opinion regarding my apparent "investing prowess",
the above was an attempt to indicate, to those who may be interested, that
there is another way (and probably several) of approaching one’s stock
selection and investing strategy.
Anyway, that’s just OUR opinion. It is, after all, YOUR choice, and YOUR money
...

As a final adjunct to this topic, I’d like to include that excellent quote of
Warren Buffett that Paul Senior brought to our attention ... "You are neither
right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because
your data and reasoning are right."

I grabbed an additional quick 2% sold 1/2 of my PWE stake and gave WEB some
more of my money to manage. I was surprised that the market didnt respond more
favorabley to berkshires announcement.

OT

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- On July 3, Warren Buffett drove himself downtown, walked
into the cavernous and nearly deserted central branch of U.S. Bank in Omaha,
descended a flight of steps, and opened his large safe-deposit box.

He took out a 1979-dated certificate for 121,737 shares of Berkshire Hathaway A
(Charts) stock, on that day worth about $11 billion - roughly one-quarter of
his Berkshire fortune.

Driving back to his office, he pondered the next step: getting that certificate
and a few others (worth only tens of millions) to Wells Fargo in Minneapolis
for conversion at a 30-to-1 ratio into around 3.75 million shares of Berkshire
B stock. He considered FedEx and elected instead to turn one of the 16 people
working at Berkshire headquarters into a courier.

As FORTUNE first reported last month, Buffett has begun to give his money to
charity. Converting the astoundingly valuable 1979 certificate is an initial
step in that process. When it is switched over, Buffett will have the B stock
he needs for handing out the 602,500 shares he has committed this year - the
first of his huge philanthropic program - to the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation and four smaller foundations.

Because of the size of that one certificate, he will also be up to his eyeballs
in B shares, having manufactured enough to fill his giving needs for most of
the next decade. (He'll keep the excess shares in a brokerage account to be
used as needed.)

Buffett says the whole exercise on July 3 made him think of the time almost 70
years ago, when he was 6 years old and his father, Howard Buffett, took him to
the same bank to open a $20 savings account. The money was a gift, the bank was
then called Omaha National, and the small passbook he got was maroon.

After that, he says, it took him five years of gifts, chores, and moneyearning
schemes to build the account to $120. Having accrued this fortune, he bought,
at age 11, his first stock: three shares of Cities Service preferred for $114.

Well, if you are going to amass $44 billion, you have to start someplace.

bruwin REGARDING HANS and SIRO (formerly SCHK.OB)
< If anyone wishes to still sell their HANS shares after what it contains, then
I suggest they seriously consider brushing up on the more relevant aspects of
Fundamental Analysis. 
Most investors here are familiar with fundamental analysis and will readily
acknowledge that HANS fundamentals look excellent. However as customary at this
thread, investors are very concerned about valuation and HANS rich valuation is
what caused the stop to drop. The correction we are seeing may or may not be an
overreaction to the earnings release. What is sure is that drop from 52$ peak
to now under 30$ in a portfolio with only 5-6 stocks hurts quite a bit,
especially since it's not the only stocks recommended by you that showed
weakness, SIRO (formerly SCHK.OB) being another one (SiRO predecessor company
SCH.OB traded around 50$/share when you made this recommendation)

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=22361527&srchtxt=SCHK

I would not care about all that if you did not continue to tout your investment
methodology as infallible and capable to producing consistent returns that are
far beyond what many fairly seasoned investors (including myself)consider
achievable. That being said, i challenge you to do one of the following:

1) Post you picks as you see fit but keep the discussions of you methodology to
a minimum

2) Do full dislcosure trading (post your buys and sell the same data). The
performance of your portfolio will speak for itself.

FWIW: I think that HANS might be worth a buy at around 25$ for a GARP type
investor.

Thanx for your constructive comments, Spekulatius.
It certainly doesn't surprise me that an investor, such as yourself, readily
acknowledges that "HANS's fundamentals look excellent".

HANS’s short term fall is what it is. Personally, I don’t sweat the short term
movements in a stock’s price if I’m confident about the current, inherent
Quality of a company’s Fundamentals. After all, nothing has been lost or gained
if one still has ownership of the stock.

In addition, I don’t believe that I’ve ever "touted" my own investment
methodology as being "infallible". Surely there can’t be much, if anything,
within the ambit of Stock selection and analysis that could be deemed
"infallible", even by the most optimistic of investors. As a "seasoned
investor" I’m sure you’re likely to agree with that.

You may consider that the "returns" I’ve referred to may not be consistently
achievable. That’s your opinion, and you’re entitled to it. I, and others who
use this strategy, happen to know differently.

IMO, however "seasoned" one may be, I believe that one should always be
prepared to consider the possibility that there may be "another way" of doing
something, or that there may be the possibility that one can glean something
from someone else that may enhance, or improve, on what one already knows.

Suffice to say, I had reason to mention, sometime in the past, what sort of
Annual Return I get on my investments. Due to the incredulity of some Board
Members, I saw fit to give some indication as to the modus operandi of my
investment strategy.
This was, in no way, to dictate to anyone how they should approach the Market.
That is entirely their own choice and their own business. I believe I’ve
CLEARLY made that point many, many times in the past.

FWIW, I certainly believe that HANS would be a good buy at "around $25" (should
it get there) for a GARP, GAAP, IFRS or any other type of investor !

Paul, impeccable timing with CSCO as the stock is up almost 10% AH due to a
good earnings report. I also added some MXIM (to a more than full position LOL)
- stock is unduly punished (IMO) as they missed GAAP earnings (after stock
option expensing) but had good operating numbers.

MXIM is a stock option sinner - stock related expenses are clearly too high and
reduced earnings for the last quarter by 20% (compared to 8% for their closest
peer LLTC). however I believe that MXIM expenses are somewhat overstated since
they did no accelerated vesting (as LLTC did in 2005) and stock option
expensing overstates the economic impact on earnings anyways. After all, as
MXIM stock has been trending down, stock options granted in the last few years
are pretty much worth nothing right now.

My big concern is that both devices and pharma may have trouble to grow - my

that JNJ may continue to go up, and MMM down!;>)

I think if one has a long perspective, this is a good buy point for a high
quality blue chip like MMM.

Congrats to Paul S. on Cisco!

Oops, looks like I was wrong on TSY. This reit gets some of its income from the
gross sales of the fast food places that rent its properties. Well, with the
gas/economy, the fast food places are seeing less sales, so TSY income may drop
enough to cause TSY to cut its dividend. It does look to investors (and to me)
like TSY is setting itself up now to cut. That's dropped the stock to new lows.

I'm not expecting defaults by the lessees, and I am guessing a dividend cut
expectation is now built into the stock price. I'll up my losing position on
the assumption that the company's geographically diversified, the properties
still have value, and that people will eventually accommodate to gas prices and
the economy and that TSY will be okay.

I had 10% of my portfolio in the IPO ICGE after three days I sold 1/3 of my
position and pulled out 2/3ds of my initial investment . the balance I rode for
a 5 bagger. a little after that I had a 3% position a company called voxware
and about half of that ended up being a 10 bagger for me. The othere one I cant
remember the name of but it was a medical company that had an agreement with
ROche and it sued it. I had some for my wife at $11 and forgot about it for
several years in one of her accounts. Roche lost the suit and purchased the
company. When I checked it it was over $50 and was about 90% of her account. I
liquidated it right away!

Im sure Jbash did quite well with faro. There were companies that if I had held
onto them would have been 10 baggers some of which i bought under a dollar like
wmb and ucoma. I just think once you have a 3-5 bagger in somthing and its a
big portion of your networth, you must be awfully confident not to think its
fairly or overvalued at that point, and we are always searching for value as
opposed to bragging rights.

I think you can do it with biotech stocks. I had a large position in ELN with
an average price of 2. I sold at 8, 16, and 27. But I've also lost easily half
my money on others.. The only biotech stock that I own now is MEDX in the low
9s.

The reason I don't think it is reported here is because ten-baggers are more in
the arena of speculative small-cap stocks. At least that is my opinion.

Regarding D-Fense stocks, I do not think that most stocks you mention (ORBT,
DRS) are cheap. Infact ORBT trades at 1x EV/Revenue and DRS at 1.6 x. I think i
like LLL more - compared to DRS the company appears stronger and is valued
lower with a 1.1X EV/revenue . I strongly consider adding to my starter
position into the current weakness.

In 1998-1999 I made a fairly large bet (for me, at the time, anyway) on
genomics stocks (INCY, NGEN, HYSQ) that yielded 20-30x gains. For instance, I
bought HYSQ at $3.69 and sold at $101, $113, $125. I work in the industry so I
would say I'm fairly well informed, but I don't think that meaningfully helped
my investments. It was mostly a matter of being in the right place at the right
time.

I don't expect to see that kind of opportunity again any time soon. It was
hardly a "value" investment, though I had some confidence that the science
would pay off... for someone... in the long run.

when you mentioned TSY previously, it looked pretty good until i listened to
the conference call...they gave a fairly mixed picture of the outlook for their
business, due to the competitive nature of the "1031" real estate business
environment, with too many bidders causing deals to be done at cap rates that
were not high enough for TSY to want to participate...that seems to be playing
out now, with their reduced guidance for the balance of the year

this time, on their call, they guided only modestly lower, but in response to
an analyst question, they acknowledged that their current payout is already
higher than they see as ideal, and that they would like to be at about 85% of
AFFO, whereas in this past quarter, they were at 95% of AFFO

as such, given that FFO is supposed to be around .60 for the second half of the
year, and assuming that the IPS business continues to show compressed margins,
it seems likely that the dividend would be cut to something like .25 to .27 a
quarter (85% of 1.20 a year, give or take a penny or two)

AFFO will probably be a little bit higher than FFO, but i would use the .25 to
be conservative, and then figure what yield i would want on my money to buy the
stock of a company which, while trading very close to book, isn't likely to
grow its earnings in the near term...for me i would want a yield of at least
10% to buy such a stock, considering all of the other ideas available with
yields in that area, and/or with better growth prospects, so i probably
wouldn't want to buy the stock unless it sold off down to 10 bucks...at that
point it would be well below book value, and the yield would be reasonably safe
IMHO, so it would pay you decently while you wait for conditions in their IPS
business to improve

on the positive side, they said that their average customer has a rent/sales
ratio of 6.7%, which is quite low, and only 19% of their rental contracts come
up for renewal in the next 5 years, so their TRS division should be in good
shape for a long time to come

of course there is a chance the stock will never drop to 10, but this is
another case where i would rather wait for my price than pay up at a price that
probably doesn't have much upside for a while

as an aside, i now see GAIN as something along those lines for the time
being...i didn't think their latest report was especially inspiring, and with
this quirky market, i won't look to buy that one unless it dips a fair
amount...i'm sure they will do fine in the long run, as i think the management
is very solid, but it appears that it is taking them quite a while to get their
money deployed, so i don't see any hurry to buy the stock

all IMHO as always

I have added to my overstock position. The stock and management seems to be
uniformly hated by institutions and by financial writers. However value guys
like the stock. I dont think there is a single buy out on this stock. Is this
the low? I have no idea, but I think this stock is running out of sellers. I
believe this may be the cheapest internet retailer out there, relative to sales
and growth prospects. I have a 2/3 position now.

Defense stocks. Perhaps I am using the wrong metrics to evaluate companies in
this sector. I'm using p/book and p/sales plus a couple others like roe. I'm
not using EV/Revenue; perhaps that is the correct or better measure. I don't
know.

I'm going to stick with my opinion that ORBT is a value as I calculate it
though. That is, the stock, now at about 1.1x stated book value
should/ought/might/could/ sell at about 1.6x bv at least, if the company can
again get sales and profits similar to what it's seen and done in past few
years.
I added a few shares as the stock dropped further today.
--------------------
LLL does seem attractive based on the measures I am using. Better now than ORBT
and DRS. Nice pop in LLL today - I assume a consequence of the news of the
terrorist attempt on the airlines. I may go for a few shares if the stock drops
again to its lows.

Regarding D-Fense stocks, ORBT, LLL, DRS -
Only 60% of ORBT's book value is tangible, so i don't think that hard assets
can really justify the stock price. it's a dinky little company that may do
well but it's small enough
that it can fail. Fundamentally I like to look at EV/price because the earnings
potential is somewhat given for D-Fense companies - with cost plus contracts
the earning margin is fixed around 10%.

DRS and LLL are very much alike, they are 2nd tier (although LLL is much closer
to 1st tier than DRS) and strong in electronics, sensors and upgrading existing
weapon systems - sectors which I expect to do well. Both DRS and LLL are
acquisitive rollup companies which have been growing by acquisitions. DRS has
stretched itself thinner (more debt on it's balance sheet) and trades at a
lower PE but looking at the EV/price it's obvious that DRS is not cheaper
compared to LLL.

ADI on firesale after a weak earnings report. i have sold my previously

they are not doing well either). option expensing does not help either. The
stock does look cheap compared to where it used to drive and the dividend and
strong balance sheet should provide some support.

Apparently nobody brought up the dreadful performance of my stock tip, so i
assume nobody here on this board owns ADI. Makes me fell better...

For what it's worth I bought some GMR last week also. Has decent cash flow and,
as you say, nice dividends in a solid industry. With BP's pipeline problems,
China beginning to ramp up filling their strategic reserves and the Fed
pausing, seemed like a reasonable play.

Curious if any of you guys are able to ride large initial positions to 10
bagger type gains?

I had 7 bagger with TRCI and 6 bagger with PMSI(later merged into HTRN).
Positions were accumulated over months and done before the big moves started.

Am sitting on a very large percentage position in GLG at average cost of $16.70

All of the above I believe I posted here (perhaps not following up on the net
gain because, for me, this board is/was more about process).

I am half way through accumulating another large position, that in PAAS which I
believe to be currently selling for about $.60 for $1.00 in value.

This is not to imply that I haven't also had some real dogs as well (but you
didn't ask for them). So far, the accounts are growing nicely in spite of the
dogs but this is a very difficult market for me to read.

I hardly ever buy a book let alone at list price now a days.. I really believe
and support public libraries but here is one big reason for not buying.. Being
in Canada, I see most books that at list are priced at 40% or so higher in CAD
then in USD when foreign exchange spread is running at 11-13%.. That is also
true of most magazines as well.. So of course being a trouble maker that I am,
I tell the folks at book store here I will pay in USD.. That does not wash and
every one's favourite rational of price difference is these prices are set few
years in advance.. LOL..
