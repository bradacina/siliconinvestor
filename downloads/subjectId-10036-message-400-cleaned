Pete,

I recommend you check out this site
(http://www.stocksmart.com/ows-bin/owa/co.g) for some good information on WHX.

Highlights:

->97est. consensus is .74/shr
->There is a new CEO to be instated 3/1/97, who has held previous positions
with GE, Uniroyal, and WCI Steel
->Fidelity is the #2 holder w/%6.11 of the company as of June 96
->Merril Lynch owns 600,000 shares as of April 96

The stock slipped to 7 7/8 today. I am pretty sure that is around the bottom.
If their earnings are .74 this year and the stock continues to trade with
PEx11, the stock should be valued at ~8 1/8. But if they are capable of a
little more...

Richard,

I agree GCG looks as though it is improving. Seems to be repeated
"non-recurring" tax charges. Some other numbers.

Cash flow 1.18 (Price 20X Cash Flow)
Current Ratio 1.3 (I screen for >2.5 usually -- any comments?)
I found a negative book value number: - 16.97. Could you explain
or confirm this.
D/E ratio of .45.
Margins, everything looks to be improving. The company cites improved
soda ash pricing and strong derivative product lines. Could you explain any
special factors that would be favorable or unfavorable
or cyclical for this company? I hate debt myself and am wondering
if you have a way for figuring this company's 200+ million LT debt
into the valuation.

Looks like you got most of your numbers you are refering to from the Market

current Qtr. later today. Also I asked my broker to get me the number and code
for the conference call, which I hope will clear up some of the simular
questions I have. I'll post what I find along with the numbers. On figuring the
large debt I took 25% off the sector ave PE of 13.8 (10.35) then factored in
the stock buy back of 5% to come up with a fair PE of 10.9.

Actually I calculated all the numbers for the current quarter myself

From:Teri Skogerboe

Jeff, This seemed the appropriate board to place this message, hopefully some
of you haven't seen it before.

This I found in John Train's book, "The Craft of Investing". This is Mr. Train
first, "Everybody who finally learns how to make money in the stock market
learns in his own way. I like this tale of his own personal enlightenment sent
by Melvid Hogan, of Houston."

The Man Who Never Lost...(Forbes, October 2, 1978)

"Right after I was discharged from the Army at the close of World War II and
went into the drilling-rig building business, I began buying and selling stocks
on the side, at first as a hobby. At the end of each year I always had a net
loss. I tried every approach I would read or hear about: technical, fundamental
and combinations of all these.but somehow I always ended up with a loss.
It may sound impossible that even a blind man would have lost money in the
rally of 1958 - but I did. In my in-and-out trading and smart switches I lost a
lot of money.
But one day in 1961 when, discouraged and frustrated, I was in the Merrill
Lynch office in Houston, a senior account executive sitting at a front desk who
I knew observed the frown on my face that he had been seeing for so many years
and motioned me over to his desk.
`Would you like to see a man,' he asked wearily, `who has never lost money in
the stock market?'
`Never had a loss?' I stammered.
`Never had a loss on balance,' the broker drawled, `and I have handled his
account for near 40 years.' Then he gestured to a hulking man dressed in
overalls sitting among the crowd of tape watchers.
`If you want to meet him, you'd better hurry,' the broker advised. `He only
comes in here once every few years except when he's buying. He always hangs
around a few minutes to gawk at the tape. He's a rice farmer and hog raiser
from down at Baytown.'
I worked my way through the crowd to find a seat by the stranger in overalls. I
introduced myself, talked about rice farming and duck hunting for a while (I am
an avid duck hunter) and gradually worked the subject around to stocks.
The stranger, to my surprise, was happy to talk about stocks. He pulled a sheet
of paper from his pocket with his list of stocks scrawled in pencil on it that
he had just finished selling and let me look at it.
I couldn't believe my eyes! The man had made over 50% long-term capital-gain
profits on the whole group. One stock in the group of 30 stocks had been shot
off the board, but others had gone up 100%, 200% and even 500%.
He explained his technique, which was the ultimate in simplicity. When during a
bear market he would read in the papers that the market was down to new lows
and the experts were predicting that it was sure to drop hundreds of points
more on the Dow, the farmer would look through a Standard & Poor's Stock Guide
and select around 30 stocks that had fallen in price below $10-solid,
profit-making, unheard of little companies (pecan growers, home furnishings,
etc.) - and paid dividends. He would come to Houston and buy a $50,000
`package' of them.
And then, one, two, three or four years later, when the stock market was
bubbling, and the prophets were talking about the Dow soaring to new highs, he
would come to town and sell his whole package. It was as simple as that.
During the subsequent years as I cultivated Mr. Womack (and hunted ducks on his
rice fields) until his death last year, I learned much of his investing
philosophy.
He equated buying stocks with buying a truckload of pigs. The lower he could
buy the pigs, when the pork market was depressed, the more profit he would make
when the next seller's market would come along. He claimed that he would rather
buy stocks under such conditions than pigs because pigs did not pay a dividend.
You must feed pigs.
He took a farming approach to the stock market in general. In rice farming
there is a planting season and a harvesting season; in his stock purchases and
sales he strictly observed the seasons.
Mr. Womack never seemed to buy a stock at its bottom or sell it at its top. He
seemed happy to buy and sell in the bottom or top range of its fluctuations.
When he was buying he had no regard whatsoever for the old clichâ€š, `Never Send
Good Money After Bad'. For example, when the bottom fell out of the market in
1970, he added another $50,000 to his previous bargain-price positions and made
a virtual killing on the whole package.
I suppose that a modern stock market technician could have found a lot of
alphas, betas, contrary opinions and other theories in Mr. Womack's simple
approach to buying and selling stocks. But none I know put the emphasis on `buy
price' that he did.
I realize that many things determine if a stock is a wise buy. But I have
learned that during a depressed stock market, if you can get a cost position in
a stock's bottom price range it will forgive a multitude of misjudgments later.
During a market rise, you can sell too soon and make a profit, sell at the top
and make a very good profit, or sell on the way down and still make a profit.
So, with so many profit probabilities in your favor, the best cost price
possible is worth waiting for.
Knowing this is always comforting during a depressed market, when a `chartist'
looks at you with alarm after you buy on his latest `sell signal'.
In sum, Mr. Womack didn't make anything complicated out of the stock market. He
taught me that you can't be buying stocks every day, week or month of the year
and make a profit, any more than you could plant rice every day, week or month
and make a crop. He changed my investing lifestyle and I have made a profit
ever since.

<This is John Train again.> "I remind the reader that although this feeling for
the rhythm of markets is a useful one to acquire, it's not the only strategy or
even the best strategy. Probably Mr. Womack would have done as well by just
buying and holding growth stocks."

You can sure cheer up a drowning man in the Wall street cesspool.
Unfortunately, Mr Womack died too soon. Today, market has been good for 5
years, no weakness yet. When will he buy? He probably all sold out his stock by
now, but market is still going up.

There are more chicken bulls on Wall street today than you can shake a stick
at. Seriously, the change on Wall Street started when efficiency and
re-engineering drove the earnings by the computer technology revolution. There
are many opportunity, but you have to work the management youself (proactive
stockholder). Netscape, AOL, Iomega, are a few stocks to be worked. Chrysler
and Western Digital just got well. There are so many. It is no longer picking
stocks but to own the companies and work hard with them.

John - There are tons of good stocks abroad that are downright cheap as you

foreign presence. For me overseas investing is too problematic - different

selling if they don't have an ADR. I haven't dealt with investments directly in

Jeff et al,

I don't know if this has been mentioned before but INFS - In Focus Systems,
looks like it is a pretty good value. In Focus make presentation projection
products. They have a thread on SI and you can look up their profile.

Some interesting statistics:

Current Price 23 (52 week H 58.25 L 12.75)
PSR 1.0
PE <20 (off of one very bad quarter last year. First Call has them at <13 for
1997)
EPS 96 1.16
97 1.93 (First Call)66%
98 2.30 (First Call)19%

They had a bad quarter last year where they lost money. Additionally, the
threat of competition and lower margins all caused the stock to tank. They came
back the next two quarters with earnings surprises so management looks like
they are sharp and the company looks for real.

I think they have about 30% of the market and are the leader. Additionally
Proxima, a competitor, looks like they are in trouble based on the thread here.

I have seen INFS' flagship the LitePro 620, which is based on TI's mirror
Digital Light Processing Technology. It is very impressive and I know of two
local companies who have purchased it. It even has good sound via JBL.

I am far from an expert investor and welcome others input on this. I made a
purchase already last week.

Not following EDUC myself; but someone may be able to give you an analysis.
300% is not the end of the world; it may be the begining if growth is projected
or the company is changing from small cap to big cap. But it might take 3 years
to get to 1000%. Intel went from about $60, split 2 for 1 twice since 1995. And
Intel is not finished yet.

Again taking profit depends on whether you own 100, 1000 or over 10,000 shares.
And if you personally need the money. One should never jump out of a frying pan
into the fire, by investing into a new stock you know nothing about.

Hi Jeff: Dont know much about INFS...but took a quick look, and
if I was interested I found what I think would be the way I'd
open a position..looked at put/calls march.
sell march22.5 put @1-3/8..( looks like it would go )b1-5/16 a1-5/8
buy march 20 call @ 4-3/8 ( looks like it would go)b4-1/8 ask 4-1/2
may get calls at 4-1/4...but if not you take the 1-3/8 from the
4-3/8 and you have her at 23 for march ex date...which gives you
a month to make up your mind..and if she goes up..you still will
be in on the profits..if she drops and your even half way carefull,
you can get out without getting hurt any more than if you bought
in right now at 23..so it's a free ride up for a month.."if she goes
up" ..except for the cost of the commisions..which in my case would
not be much..about $72 for the ride if I did 5 contracts each way.
plus another $12 to exersize the calls..
I don't know her well enough to play it...I have to follow a stock
for a while before I jump in, except I some times do a dead cat bounce, with
calls..( in and out fast on something that look like
it got hit hard unfairly ) got to be fast on the dead cat bounce.

Much of the existing base is VGA and not very sharp or bright. I think that, in
addition to new sales, there is a considerable upgrade market. However, there
is a lot of competition out there.

Additionally, though INFS is not currently targeting this market because of the
price point, the home theatre market is looming out there. With the
introduction of DVD and digital television on the horizon, there are areas for
market growth. Not a major reason to buy the stock, but potential room for

The industry became more competitive. The business model for the industry

INFS hit the wall last year, falling from 58 into the teens last year,
suffering a severe margin decrease because of competition. They survived and
turned it around quickly (they spent money last year price protecting their

Arthur, Concerning when/what Mr. Womack would buy in this new-world market, I
think he would have maybe bought Merck, Glaxo and Pfizer when Pres. Clinton had
the whole Wall Street world afraid to touch them (just a few years back). And,
if he could have relaxed his dividend requirement, the Semi-equipment stocks
were ABSOLUTE bargains about 3-4 months ago and are still good buys in my
opinion.
And as John Train stated in his closing, this is not the only strategy that
works, he could possibly have done just as well by buying and holding growth
stocks.
I would be interested to know what 1000 shares of AMAT or NVLS bought and held
10 years ago would be worth now......I bet a whole heck of a lot.

I worked in the semi industry for over 30 years. The equipment today even
though they are batch processing; is very much automated. Although I am happy
about the mfg's; the submicron rule is close to the limit (each atom is being
counted; submicron will only work if active areas are larger than several
hundred atoms). Each atom is 10to -9 microns and submicron rule is already 10to
-7 microns. Theoretical limits of doped silicon regions are upon us. Dr. Gordon
Moore at Intel already sounded the alarm!

On the other hand, the present 0.35 micron yields are fabulous. So, invest all
you want. Beyond 0.08micron rule, the semi people will come to a halt with very
low yields if at all. We hope the equipment people should spend sometime
designing Hard disk assembly equipment to prepare for the dead end of submicron
technology. We are informing the industry of this doping in silicon limit, now.

Investors buy at ask price from MM; sell at bid price to MM. MM's buy from each
other at prices they agree on; or some 1/32 or 1/64 discount. No investor can
buy and sell to each other; because you have to go through clearing house.
Unless you are willing to sell the stock to me privately and sign the back of
the certificate; I can not buy from you at a brokerage house. You have the
certificate in street name at the broker, never in your own name. The work flow
at broker's, prevent you from buy and sell to other customers.

However, at Instinet, the customer themselves offer stocks for sell. Prices are
way off because buyers do not have liquidity same as specialists on NYSE or
MM's at trading desk of large brokers. All internet brokers work off a clearing
house; which owns some stock and has money to buy stock. If you look at 1
minute interval intraday charts, you can see thin markets where MM's have to be
the buyers or sellers.

RTEC is one of the stocks I followed; reminded me of Osborne. Although it is
better than Osborne because it has new and powerful 200mhz cpu delivered. It
seems that the type of financing will determine the future price of RTEC. At
the moment, the 40 mhz cpu inventory has to be salvaged by more parallel (up to
32 SMP) cpu's on new motherboard designs and production. Otherwise, just
abandon the 40 mhz cpus would miss out on many installed SPARC bases which are
still operating slower cpus yet( in schools).

Some opportunity exists on the turn around if financing does not reverse split.
And volume of sales revenue will increase because of aggresive push of SMP of
slow cpus (bargain for slow SUN's to be upgraded and there are many). MM's RTEC
stock inventory seems to be accumulating. If pull back after Feb 28, 1997
occurs, hold recommandation can be change to buy for a technical correction.

Scott - Interesting about Phil Fisher/Ken Fisher. I never heard of Phil.
Anyhow, the thing I can tell you about Fisher's method from 1st hand experience
is that for it to work, you need to have a "Super Company" before you have a
"Super Stock". Most of the stocks I've picked in the past 5 years by sticking
with the rules in the book have been big winners. The only thing I relax now is
that I will buy at PSRs up to 1.5 on some companies. I'd say my typical initial
buy is around PSR=1.0. I started doing this a couple of years ago and then
O'Shaughnessy's book came out last year recommending the purchase of stocks
with PSRs < 1.5. So I'm pretty confident in this method.

<<Each atom is 10to -9
microns and submicron rule is already 10to -7 microns.>>

I don't exactly follow. Can you clarify this statement. By 10to -9 microns I
assume you mean 10EE-9 microns, or 10EE-15 meters, or 10to -15 meters (ability
to do superscripts would be nice). This number sounded way off so I looked up
the radius of atomic silicon with a tetrahedral covalent bond (like it is in
normal silicon), I find an atomic radius of 1.17 anstroms or 1.17EE-10 meters
(1.17to -10 meters). Unless I miss understood you have quoted an atomic size of
silicon that is 6 orders of magnitude off. I also don't understand your
reference to the submicron rule. Could you please clarify. After reading a
Scientific American article on when Moore's law will breakdown due to
theoretical limits I became interested in the topic. I would like to better
understand your message since the theoretical limits of semiconductor sizes has
dramatic implications for the future of the semiconductor and semiconductor

Thank you, Michael

Moore theory is troublesome because of the linearity of the curve, he likes to
look at. Sub micron of the line width in lithography is below one micro-meter,
or 10 to the power of -7 meter. Silicon has a density of 5.23 x 10 to the power
of 22 per cc. Cube root gives you the space each atom takes. The resistivity of
silicon is determined by parts per billion of "substitution" impurity, ie.
boron or phosphorus taking the space of silicon atom. When the active area is
small, a few hundred atoms x the depth of the active area= total silicon atoms.
Slight area inaccuracy will change the effective resistivity of the usable
active area or rather volume, depending on the number of impurity atoms
included in the volume. Resistivity determines the voltage or beta of the
transistor if resistivity is too low. In Cmos, the source to drain resistance.
If you are designing the IC, you will be looking at the tolerance of the number
of silicon atoms and number of impurity atoms you need in the active area or
rather volume of silicon. That is why the limit is coming upon us on how small
a transistor can be. And how small a line width can be. But the number of
impurity per billion of silicon atoms is very few for high resistivity silicon.

Thank you everyone for the good information on this thread. I have been lurking
here for quite a while. One of my favorite value picks just released FY 96 4th
quarter earnings. Corcom (CORC) makes Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
products. According to their homepage they are the world leader in RFI
technology. Based upon FY 96 trailing results they are trading as of today at a
PSR of 0.96 and a P/E of 5.8. Yet they have seen great growth over the past 3
years, 157% for FY 93-94 earnings, 115% for FY 94-95, and based upon todays
year end results 94% for FY 95-96.
Here is some background. In Jan 95 Europe's equivalent of the FCC passed strict
RFI/EMI (Electro-magnetic impulse) regulations. In a nut shell these
regulations limit the amount of radiated electro-magnetic noise and power line
noise that can be given off by various electronic equipment. Corcom produces
filters to eliminate this electrical noise. Since this new regulation passed
they have seen great sales growth in europe. They also sell filters used to
shield digital equipment from noise. They have seen tremendous sales growth in
their line of filters used by modem manufacturers. They did have a tax
provision of $1,026,000 for FY 96 that I don't understand yet. I have an e-mail
into the CFO asking about this. If any one is interested in contacting the
company the Chief Financial Officer (Mr Thomas Buns) can be e-mailed at
info@cor.com. I have e-mailed him twice, he personnelly responded both times
the first time by the following day and the second time I received his reply 4
hours after sending the message.

Here is part of the earnings release

<<<<Tuesday February 18 1:48 PM EDT

Corcom, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter Profits

LIBERTYVILLE, Ill., Feb. 18 /PRNewswire/ -- Corcom Inc announced today that it
has recorded a net profit of $1,871,000
($.47 per share) on sales of $8,720,000 for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31,
1996. This compares to a net profit of
$786,000 ($.20 per share) on sales of $8,320,000 for the fourth quarter of
1995. Included in the fourth quarter earnings for
1996 is an income tax benefit of $1,026,000 resulting principally from a
decrease in the tax valuation allowance which existed
at the beginning of 1996.

For the full year 1996, the company has recorded a net profit of $5,472,000
($1.38 per share) on sales of $33,166,000 as
compared with a net profit of $2,786,000 ($.72 per share) on sales of
$30,660,000 for 1995. Full year 1996 earnings include
an income tax benefit of $1,789,000 resulting principally from a decrease in
the tax valuation allowance which existed at the
beginning of 1996.

Management of the manufacturer of electronic RFI filters and power entry
products stated that the company continues to
experience strong demand for its products, spurred in part by new regulations
designed to limit the RFI emissions of electronic
equipment shipped into the European community. Company President Werner E.
Neuman stated, "Our continuous
improvement programs and new product introductions have produced the desired
result: enabling us to increase sales, improve
operating margins, and penetrate new markets." >> >>

I looked at this stock a couple of weeks ago. In trying to make a purchase
(ultimately unsuccessful), I came to the conclusion that there aren't a whole
lot of shares out there going back and forth. The company is somewhat small
(annual revenue of $33M).

Management succession may be a problem. The president, CEO, or whatever is
pretty old and owns quite of bit of stock. (MarketGuide says insider ownership
is 58%.)

FMR Corp. (Fidelity) owns something like 207,000 shares of approximately 3.8M

On the upside, the fundamentals look really good.

Does this then mean that the only hope of stretching out Moore's law a bit
longer is to get yet more pure silicon? If this is what you mean it makes sense
also. But it sounds like you doubt that it can get more pure than it already
is. Who manufacturers this stuff anyhow - just out of curiosity?

Any thoughts on ABPCA (Au Bon Pain)? Peter Lynch recommended this stock in Jan
94 in the mid 20's and bought in himself at 22.75. Stock is at 8 now. He is
still recomending it (Jan. 97 Worth pg.45)on the basis that the company has
gotten a handle on their margins by improving their demographics, and he
predicts that the expansion of ST. Louis Bread franchises from 33 to 250+
restaurants, will now be the key to the company's sucess. Says he bought more
shares in Oct-Nov when the price was 6-7.5.

My reasoning is that if Peter Lynch is dollar cost averaging (at 6 -7.5)in a
stock that he originally bought for 22.75 (as opposed to throwing the towel
in)and the price is now below 8,there could be some good upside potential here.

The company has a low PSR (0.39) and looks like a good value. Earnings outlook
looks bleak for now, but I think there could be a turnaround in the works.

I am new to value investing and would appreciate any opinions on this company.

No one of a good mind listen to Moore's law. It's too general to believe it can
be applied to everything. I know Dr. moore, he was talking about a specific
condition.

Area slight change is due to tolerance of what lithography machines give. Wafer
uniformity by crystal growth has 10-15% resistivity variation by laws of
physics. Nonuniform oxygen gettering used to tie up other impurities, will be
inside the small volume, reducing silicon atoms further. This means when area
gets smaller, nonuniformity becomes a bigger issue. Now, I sounded like Dr.
Moore.

In ant case, We will not likely to worry about it until lithigraphy pushes
beyond 0.08 micron rule. After that semiconductor lithography people will be
looking for other businesses for future growth. Why not start now?

Miklosh - Sorry I didn't get back with you earlier on ABPCA. As you say, from
the PSR standpoint it looks good. It also looks like there is good upside
potential and PL's recommendation and sticktoitiveness is also a plus.

I wouldn't buy it for several reasons which are as follows:
1. I only buy stocks that I understand. I don't begin to understand retail -
including restaurants.
2. Competition is fierce in this area which is what got them in trouble in the
first place. I try to find near-monopolies or companies that almost can't lose
unless management is totally inept. This is the kind of sector that is
difficult to stay ahead in, even with superior management.
3. There are other companies competing for my investing dollars that are better
fits for my investing style and scope of knowledge about businesses. Of recent,
OLS and COHU.

If you want to really find out how much management is committed to turning the
company around, pull the latest Proxy Statement (14A) from Edgar and take a
look at management's compensation package. If they are paid a lot, have little
stock and options, and bonuses not tied to performance, then they are probably
not very confident of the turnaround.

Michael - I agree with you. Semis are tricky and there will be some big losers
WHEN the market takes a hit - which might happen next week or next year. My
portfolio is set up to minimize mid-term downside risk - yes even with semi cap
equipment stocks.

I tend to believe that there will be some triggering event as the article
states but that it might not necessarily be internal to the system.

If its internal, IMHO its going to be inflation. In my own business, wage
inflation is very high because of the low unemployment. Its starting to trickle
down to lower wage categories also. Other ominous signs: airline strike +
upcoming negotiations by other airlines. Other labor strikes in the auto
industry.

IMHO value investing is the best hedge against the inevitable. And as we both

To keep you all upto date on Burke Mills (NASDAQ:BMLS), although the
Company had previously told me that 1996 earnings would be released
toward the end of March, BMLS released them yesterday.

Although I was "blind-sided" by the timing of the release, I am rather
pleased about the results that were announced, since they are better
than I projected in my February 3rd Analysis of the Company in The
Napeague Letter, and they confirm that the Company's turn-around is on
track.

I've updated the summary of Burke's quarterly financial statements to
include the most recent quarter to show that its previous trends are
continuing. Revenue growth rebounded in the first quarter of 1996
and appears to be accelerating, and gross profits are rising toward the
levels achieved prior to the conversion to the new dying process.

----------- 1996 ---------- --------- 1995 ------------
4th 3rd 2nd 1st 4th 3rd 2nd 1st
------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
Revenues 10,214 10,226 10,304 9,905 8,632 7,385 8,586 9,545
Gross Profit 1,183 1,104 785 690 945 258 1,098 1,181
Pre-tax Income 424 469 43 ( 67) 184 ( 284) 606 650
Net Income 314 285 26 ( 41) 352 ( 173) 369 396
Net Income/Sh 0.11 0.10 0.01 (0.02) 0.13 ( .06) 0.14 0.14

Gross Margin 12% 11% 8% 7% 11% 4% 13% 12%

As you can see, it is not too meaningful to compare the latest quarter
with the fourth quarter of 1995, since the results for that quarter were
impacted by non-recurring tax benefits.

In my February 3rd Analysis, I projected total 1996 revenues of
$41,225,000, and actual revenues were slightly lower, at $40,649,000.
I projected earnings per share of $0.19, while actual results were
$0.21 per share.

The press release issued by the Company notes that "As the company
moves into 1997, the positive impact of the improvements in the dyeing
operation may be offset by the market for upholstery yarn that is
currently slow and could have an impact on first quarter results."
Other indicators do not show that the upholstery segment is slowing
down, but I will discuss this with BMLS management in the near future.

I will update my Analysis as soon as I have had a chance to review the
Company's 10-K Report. A complete copy of this press release can be
obtained from a number of sources, including Yahoo.

too, these are just the stuff that comes to mind now;please don't assume I own
or recommend them to you or anyone else. thanks) Yes, some of the posts here
are by inexperienced people who have not clearly defined "value" (or have
cockamayme ideas of value - like the stock dropped 50%, so it must be a value
at this new low price, or maybe it sells for $1.37/sh. , ergo it's cheap), but
there is a lot of pretty good Graham type stuff being mentioned here too (even
if Ben himself is not talked about) IMHO. And of course, I for one, would
welcome any Graham type stocks you believe are out there that have not been
mentioned that could be brought to the readers' attention here.

John - Evaluating management is relatively straightforward but definitely
beyond the scope of a post here. Each time I buy a company I write up a summary
of everything I review for my own reference. I posted the ones for OLS and COHU
on this thread in the past month or so and it includes the summary evaluation
of management. The attitudes of Fisher's is that "when you buy a stock, you are
putting your trust in management to get results. If they don't have a good
track record, you can't expect them to produce in the future." I've used Ken
Fisher's book "Super Stocks" (1984) and Paul Senior who has been doing this a
lot longer than I have also has the following references.

<<instead of proposing several ideas, pick a basket of five stocks and follow
their
performance. If one fails performance criteria, drop it and add another.
Why not start with OLS, COHU, and WHX? >>

Therein lies the problem. Value investing encompasses many different
approaches. I personally don't agree with any of those three. This thread is
meant to be a fountain of ideas and info. It has been working so far. You can
always start a "Basket of Value Stocks" thread. But this one is working well
enough given its broad purpose. Other opinions welcome.

Jeff: Thanks for the comments and references. You might be interested in a book
I just finished, WARREN BUFFET: THE MAKING OF A CAPITALIST. I loaned it to a
friend last night and I can't remember the name of the author. Basically, its
Buffet's autobiography. Very interesting reading. Good insight into Buffet,
Graham, Munger, their investment philosophies and development, Buffet's famous
decisions and a very interesting chapter on the Saloman brothers affair. The
book has made a lasting impression on me.

Thank you, John

Buffet is old fashioned investor, no technology stocks. Today, management
evaluation has to include technology outlook. My test of management skills is
to look at their company future. That includes technology advancement in the
particular field the company is in. Sometimes overnight the company is
worthless when a new company has a better technology (3COM?). Very tough. Even
low tech companies, people have to look at their automation in their plants.
The accounting control in computer systems. The network communications
companies have. But if you buy Hathaway, you buy Buffet and Solomon Bros.,
nothing wrong with that, as of now. Can you still sleep soundly tonight?

My banker used to tell me he would not loan any money if he couldn't sleep that
night?

$$$$ TO ALL: EQNX $$$$$$

Equinox reports 1996 sales up 23%, profits up 70%

BusinessWire, Thursday, February 20, 1997 at 11:02

SUNRISE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 20, 1997--Equinox Systems
Inc. (NASDAQ:EQNX) Thursday reported results for its fourth quarter
and year ended Dec. 31, 1996.
Sales in 1996 increased 23% to $24,779,000 from $20,222,000 in
1995. Net income increased 70% to $2,755,000, or $0.68 per share,
from $1,620,000 or $0.39 per share in 1995.
Sales in the fourth quarter of 1996 decreased 2% to
$6,047,000 from $6,186,000 in 1995. Net income decreased 7% to
$669,000 or $0.17 per share from $719,000 or $0.18 per share in the
same period last year.
Bill Dambrackas, Equinox president and founder commented: "We're
very pleased with our sales and earnings growth in 1996 despite the
slight fourth quarter decline. As we anticipated in our
Dec. 4, 1996 press release, this fourth quarter slowdown was primarily
due to timing of OEM orders. Subsequent to year-end, OEM orders for
first quarter shipments substantially improved and are now back on
track with our expectations.
"Increasing OEM sales are a major growth opportunity for us, but
OEMs are typically more volatile than distributors. Sales through
our distribution channel represent a very dependable 63% of our
revenues. They increased 22% in 1996 and are expected to continue
growing throughout 1997.
"Our fundamentals also strengthened in 1996. Gross margins
improved. Our investment in new product development increased
23%, continuing at 11% of revenues. SG&A expenses declined to 22% of
revenues from 27%. Inventories decreased and the average age of our
accounts receivable declined to 51 days from 61 days. Cash increased
to $14.3 million, or $3.50 per share, (despite spending over
$2 million for repurchases of our stock) and we continue to be
debt-free."

NMRX is starting to move. No news today but the stock has hit $5. Would be
interested in opinions on Phoenix Technology. This is admittedly a high PSR but
has lots of cash and marketable securities, and is involved in two areas, one
in which it is dominant and the other which appears to be growing at a 35-40%

All: Any opinions on why the mining shares are moving up in the last
two weeks, perhaps a signal that the long awaited correction to this
bull market is close at hand? The CBOE gold index, AMEX golds bug
index, Echo Bay (ECO), Homestake (HM), Pegasus (PGU), Helca (HL),
CDE, Battle Mtn Gold (BMG), to mention just a few are all rallying.
Is it just a technical rally after their long declines or is smart
money already anticipating higher inflation down the road, wage or
otherwise? Certainly, we know gasoline prices at the pump have already
started up and will keep going up as the spring and summer driving
seasons approach.

Pete - I echo the sentiments of Doc Burry. There are a lot of different types
of Value Investing styles and IMO comparing results over a short term is not a
reasonable comparison. For example, stocks like OLS and some of Mike's may not
show great results for another 6-9 months or longer. Companies like COHU on the
other hand, are already up 15% over the last several weeks. Mike wouldn't
consider some of my picks as "Value Stocks" and I wouldn't consider some of his
picks as "Value Stocks" because of our style differences.

Mike has been turning up a lot of microcaps some of which have been fast
movers. They have been buying and making money. A few of us PSR-types have been
doing some detailed research on companies but with the "Fisher style", you may
only turn up 3-4 real good companies a year. Using this style, you can't decide
at 8am that you are going to buy a Fisher-type "Super Stock" today, have your
screens done buy noon, and buy by 1PM. "Super Stock" hunting more resembles a
fishing trip where you only catch a few big ones on a long trip. I think last
year about 1 in 10 companies I analyzed turned out to be worth buying. And
thats after getting good screening data.

Regarding time to buy and sell, Reuters' nightly business news have NYSE and
NASDAQ index charts for the day. Interesting to note, is 11am and 1:30pm is the
time to sell. The index generally is at a high point. But 2:00-3:00pm is
generally the low point of the day, buying should be done then.

This apparently has something to do with how people decides around lunch;
although I have found most brokers eat lunch at their desks.

Not following EQNX myself but noticed they are probably active in network and

Hedge-fund manager James Cramer believes the 11 A.M. rally is due to the timing
of the mail. By that time, Cramer says, the mutual fund managers have opened
their mail and know how much new money they have taken in and how much they now
have to buy.

"John - I've Read the Buffett autobiograhy and it is very good. I've also read

I'm not aware of Buffett ever writing an autobiography. Did you perhaps mean
Roger Lowenstein's biography on Buffett entitled, Buffet: The Making of an
American Capitalist? That's a great book. I would go so far to say it should be
required reading for any serious investor.

The BIG MONEY in the know boys, ease into the mining cos before the price of
gold goes up...after they get a position in the mining cos
they put money into gold and that goes up..which causes the mining
cos to rise even more..at the end of the cycle..they will sell the
cos, then the gold.
Look at average volume on CCH, then look at todays volume..
they are buying it up from the funbdumbs...49% of CCH is owned
but institutional follow the leader types..they are being told
to sell by the same people doing the buying..
CCH did 5x it's normal volume today..look out gold is about to
go up !

Technical analyse shows March 15 peak then May 15 peak, more or less every year
(401k). Oct month( people back from vacation in Sept try too hard to push
prices up) is always crash possible (1929-1987); which can be averted by FED
having 2 billion loans ready at the overnight discount window in NYC. That is
why no crash since 1988 the BUSH administration. Last year 1996 is the only
year recently that July was unstable( Wayne Angel at Bear Sterns scared
business on interest rate increase). April 15 tax payment is the reason for the
dip between march and may. Summer months are generally soft due to vacations.
Then, year end tax loss selling is the only time for bargains. But, 1995 there
was a summer rally spurred by the coming of submicron technology, tech stocks
went wild.

All other aspects of the market is probably related to individual stock rather
than overall market.

Buffet does not manage other people's money either, only his own Hathaway which
you can buy. And Solomon Bros. is too wild on their futures bets on silver,
etc. and don't forget their periodic large baskets of programmed computer

I should put some money on that.

Arthur - I have been experiencing steady consulting rate inflation over the
past 18 months more than I have in 15 years in the software consulting
business. I have a number of other contractors that work for me and they are
reporting the same thing. Also, there are bidding wars going on all over
Silicon Valley for software talent. This is obviously good for us but I think
inflation is definitely on the rise in a big way and its not showing up as
significant in the numbers yet. IMO the customers haven't been able to pass on
development costs to the consumers yet. I think the reports may be a "wake up
call". Also, note other recent signs: American Pilots demanding higher wages
when they are already the highest in the industry. Several other smaller
strikes in the automotive sector. Comments?

At any rate, I think true Value Investors are going to be well positioned for
the inevitable.
