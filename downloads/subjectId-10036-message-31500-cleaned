2008 DIVIDEND FORECAST
American Capital reiterates its 2008 dividend forecast of $4.19 per share...
The remaining 2008 dividends per share are forecast to be in the following
quarterly amounts.
$1.05 for Q3 2008, 14% increase over Q3 2007; and
$1.10 for Q4 2008, 10% increase over Q4 2007.

2008 FORECASTS
American Capital is forecasting its Earnings less appreciation and depreciation
("Realized Earnings") for the second quarter of 2008 will exceed $1.10 per
diluted share.

American Capital reiterates its forecast that its 2008 ordinary taxable income
will exceed its 2007 ordinary taxable income. American Capital forecasts that
almost half of its 2008 ordinary taxable income will be rolled over into 2009
to pay 2009 dividends.

American Capital reiterates its forecast that its 2008 taxable net long term
capital gains will exceed its 2007 taxable net long term capital gains.
American Capital forecasts that all of its 2008 taxable net long term capital
gains will be rolled over into 2009 to pay 2009 dividends.

American Capital reiterates its forecast that it will roll over more than $500
million of ordinary taxable income and net long term capital gains from 2008
into 2009.

The preceding dividend forecast and other forecasts above assume that for 2008
there will be a recession in the U.S., no new capital will be raised at
American Capital, American Capital will produce significant internally
generated liquidity available for new investments and American Capital buyout
investment volume will increasingly be funded by funds under management.

...We expect assets that have experienced $656 million of depreciation in this
or a prior quarter to appreciate and reverse this depreciation, as we hold the
assets to settlement or maturity. The underlying credit quality of these assets
remains in line with our forecasts, made at the time the investments were
underwritten, which include a recession...

Right. I'm guessing div will be secure for two years. One lousy scenario is
then that company will be in some sort of run-off mode, with stock down and
dividends less. But with stated book value at $28 now and even with stock
falling further, it would still be a value given the large dividends paid out
these next two years. So I am guessing and betting.

Some bets sort of have to be made now with the expectation that the US economy
will not totally collapse and that the USA will at least muddle through. And
that the stock market in 2011 will see - if not better times - then at least
different times and problems.

OTOH, I've been very wrong on this stock, on all bdc's it seems, and many other
stocks as well.

Here are the recent holdings in the CGM Focus fund (CGMFX) that Ken Heebner
manages. You mentioned this fund back in January and its worth a look to see
what he continues to hold.
http://quicktake.morningstar.com/fundnet/Holdings.aspx?Country=USA&Symbol=CGMFX

Here are a few of the foreign holdings that caught my attention:
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SID (NYSE)
Gerdau SA GGB (NYSE)
Bank Bradesco BBD (NYSE)
Unibanco - Union of Brazilian Banks S.A. UBB (NYSE)

It looks like he also had a short position with Washington Mutual as one of his
top five positions. He did well with his WM short as earlier this week it
traded down to $3.03 (a 35% loss on the day!). I wonder if he covered?

Do any of his current holdings look like "value" opportunities to you. If so,
which ones do you like?

ALD -- found this elsewhere. fyi.

Morningstar doesn't cover ACAS, but these comments on ALD might give
perspective:

Allied Capital ALD
Analyst Note | Ryan Lentell | 07-10-2008

We are reducing our fair value estimate for Allied Capital ALD as we believe
the probability of near-term dividend growth is off the table, given the
dramatic decline in the share price. The market is now placing an almost 20%
cost of equity on Allied and other business-development companies, as
demonstrated by the approximate 20% yield on most participants in the sector.
At current market prices, Allied will not be able to raise equity, which is
accretive to current shareholders by allowing it to increase its dividend.
Therefore, we are reverting to our no-growth valuation level.

We believe the current dividend is not in jeopardy at this time. Allied has
sufficient spillover income to cover its entire 2008 dividend. Moreover, the
firm has about $235 million in deferred installment sale taxable income, which
is income that Allied has effectively forestalled by rolling capital gains from
asset sales into bonds provided to purchasers of its investments. Effectively,
this covers about 50% of Allied's 2009 dividend. Moreover, Allied is currently
producing about $70 million in net investment income (excluding net realized
investment income) quarterly, which covers 70% of the current dividend. We
believe net investment income should expand as Allied reinvests capital into
higher-yielding investments and earnings from fees on its three managed funds
pick up over the next year. Thanks to the income Allied has yet to pay out and
income it produces quarterly, it appears the current dividend is not in
jeopardy.

We believe the ultimate test for Allied and the other business-development
companies will be how their underwriting holds up during the economic slowdown.
If its underwriting fails, Allied could be forced to book large realized losses
that could trigger a dividend cut. We will be closely watching the performance
of Allied's assets as the economy weakens. As of March 2008, nonaccrual loans
stood at a manageable amount of only 3.3% of Allied's portfolio of investments.

Not one of my better moves. Usually I'm much better at

Thinking it's too late to sell. Shares are in a long

Financials it appears are going to be going down to
ridiculous prices. Not calling any bottoms or dip buying
anymore. That's proven to be suicide.

If or when AIB sells at $10 a share, I'll get interested
again. Otherwise - will wait for it to show some strength
on the upside.

re BDN
I would recommend to be careful with BDN. leverage is simply too high and the
valuation in terms of EBITDA/EV is not favorable. Basically BDN trades at 12x
EV/EBITDA. Since most of the EV consists of debt (3B$ Debt 1.2B$ market cap),
the lower equity prices do not improve this ratio a lot. now they are trying to
reduce leverage (because cost of capital is going up) which so far has led to
writeoffs. I take this as an indication that the assets on BDN's balance sheet
are not undervalued.

HRP seems like a better deal. there EV/EBITDA ratio is about 10.4 which is
approx. 15% less than BDN. They deploy less leverage and they were also able to
sell some properties for a book value gain.

The analysis below is still mostly correct. Just looking at market cap/FFO does
not cut it in a capital constraint environment. Same is true for some hotel
REITS. I warned out AHT which also was not cheap enough in terms of EV/EBITDA.
their future looks bleak, IMO.

Not so sure about CGM having value buys. A few maybe on some measures I use.
More could be buys based on "themes"; not as value plays.

Here's my opinion on CGM top 25 as we know them today:

US Steel, Nucor. I've no opinion.

American Mobile ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AMX ). I have a few shares. Last
added 7/9/08 @ 51.08

Arcelor Mittal. No opinion

Washington Mutual. Sold awhile back. No opinion now

Brazilian Petroleum Corporation or PBR. I have a full position. A hold for me.
I'd not recommend it as a "value" buy for others.

Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FCX ). 5/29/08
@$113.77 my latest add. I have only a few shares in total.

Mosaic and Potash: I missed the fertilizer boom, and do not follow these stocks
now.

Southern Copper http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PCU . I hold shares from 2005. No
interest in adding now.

Schlumberger http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SLB . I hold a few shares bought from
$98 to $77.

Monsanto, Alcoa. No opinion.

CGM has three Brazilian Banks - Itau, Bradesco, Unibanco. I chose only one for
a play on Brazilian oil development prosperity. I can't remember why I chose
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BBD over the others, but I have a moderate
position. Last buy 3/08 @ $19.33. I'll add more if it drops on no adverse news.

Devon: After no adds since 2005, I've upped my holdings this month to a full
position. Most purchases 118-122. Latest and lowest price $107.08 7/8/08. In
addition to the '09 forward p/e a little under 8x (Yahoo consenus est.), I like
DVN for the Montney and Haynesville shale exposure.

Weatherford. No opinion.

Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SID. I missed this one. I like Brazilian related
steel stocks for the buildout of PBR oil business and for Brazilian
infrastructure. I'll have to look at this one again.

Gerdau http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GGB Added a little to my exploratory
position 7/10/08 @$20.88. Again, Brazilian steel stock play.

Vimpel. No opinion. Stock's come down. Might be worth a closer look now.

Tuckcell. http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TKC I have a small exploratory position
bought at $19.38 (ouch) on 5/15/08. A prominent Turkish stock, and an okay play
on growth of cell phone usage. Turkish stock market has killed many...small
position and I'll be cautious on adding.

Apache. A hold for me. (Position established in '06). I'd not add.

No opinion on Mechel or Alum. Co. of China.

Nice analysis, but with Heebner's turnover it is quite possible that he does
not hold most of these stocks by now.

Edit: For fun, I'll add my opinion:

US Steel - with most of the steels, I am not sure if they can pass the high
cost of iron ore and coal to their consumers. I have PKX, but I would probably
not buy any steels on macro reasons. OTOH, they may be somewhat "oligopolists"
if steel cannot be efficiently exported/imported. Then they could hold margins
fine.

Nucor - Expensive.

American Mobile (AMX) - Expensive

Arcelor Mittal. - Not interested based on jumpy ROE

Washington Mutual. - Was always quite dinky, not sure what Bill Nygren saw in
it.

Brazilian Petroleum Corporation or PBR. - I have some. A hold at these prices.

Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX) - Not interested based on jumpy ROE

Mosaic and Potash: Ditto on missed the fertilizer boom and not clear whether
this will continue.

Southern Copper PCU. - Not interested based on jumpy ROE

Schlumberger SLB. Not interested based on jumpy ROE

Monsanto - Not interested based on low ROE

Alcoa - Not interested based on low ROE

Itau, Bradesco, Unibanco - do not buy banks and other financials except for
Buffett's holdings.

Devon - Hold here.

Weatherford - Not interested based on low ROE

Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SID. - High debt/equity.

Gerdau GGB - see above on steels.

Vimpel - I hold small position, may sell though. Not very cheap.

So far Buffett's buys USB and WFC reported pretty good results, even though USB
sold off ~5% after reporting (now it is up 5% or so from there - volatile

Hi Spekulatius - Is it typical for these REITs to maintain a high debt ratio as
it provides them more leverage and better overall return? Or, have you noticed
that over the typical real estate cycle, a good management team will pay down
more debt during the cycle bottom so they can weather any prolonged downturn. I
have not followed these REITs enough to know what the standard practice is in a
typical real estate cycle. I do know that when times get tough, management
needs to do everything possible to deleverage and pay down as much outstanding
debt as affordable, keep vacancy rates low and stagger leases so any
significant available space does not hit in any one period.

After reviewing all of BDNs leases on their web site, it appears that
management has accomplished this especially in their core eastern markets.

I recently increased my BDN position after I read that they sold some
properties with the proceeds used to reduce their debt. These properties had
the largest vacancy rates (one piece was new construction now available in a
soft market). To me, I felt management was being conservative and took the
prudent path so they could weather any prolong down turn in this real estate
cycle.

Brandywine sells Oakland towers for $412 million to CIM Group
http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2008/06/30/daily45.htm
?ana=yfcpc

From the article:"... The deal includes assumption of about $95.6 million in
existing mortgage loans. The properties included in the sale are One Kaiser
Plaza, also known as The Ordway building, 28 stories, 515,070 square feet; 1901
Harrison St., 17 stories and 272,100 square feet; 1333 Broadway, 10 stories,
238,394 square feet; 2101 Webster St., 20 stories and 464,424 square feet; and
the recently completed, unleased 2100 Franklin St., 10 stories and 215,000
square feet.

The first four properties were about 89 percent occupied as of May 31, said
Brandywine (NYSE: BDN)..."

Management had to be creative to close this deal. "...About $40 million of the
$316.9 million in cash due at the closing has been deferred as a two-year
interest-free loan to the buyer...".

Brandywine expected to realize $269.9 million of cash proceeds at closing with
the proceeds used to pay down debt. That equates to $3.08/share cash which if
applied to their outstanding debt ($3.06B) would represent a 8.9% reduction in
their long term debt.

After the dust settles, I believe their net FFO will increase and their overall
portfolio debt will be less. They are still leveraged as you pointed out but
with this recent transaction, just not as much.

I have been wrong in the past and may very well be missing something and am
wrong in my analysis. From the recent price action, the market may be pricing
in some other financial "event" or it could be sellers just throwing in the
towel at these price levels (multi-year lows).

Hi Paul - Thanks for pointing this one out.

I started a small position in the penny stock DEEP DOWN, INC. (OTC BB: DPDW.OB)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=DPDW.OB . I think there is some hidden value in
this company, specifically with their recent acquisition of Flotation
Technologies.

This is an interesting company that actually earns money. Deep Down, Inc.
provides products and services to the offshore energy industry to support
deepwater exploration, development, and production of oil and gas, and other
maritime operations worldwide.

Here is the S&P report from their Web page.
http://solutions.standardandpoors.com/NASApp/WS/EntryServlet?pc=IVS&tracking=IV
DEEP_DOWN_INC&auth=user&pagename=encrStockReportHTML&company=185224108162123214
14174045232073020156044150092

The item that stuck out to me is their revenue growth in 2007 and their results
so far for 2008. (These figures do not include the $18 million "letter of
intent" for follow on orders from their Flotation Technologies division.)

This is unusual for a penny stock company but they appear to accomplish this by
acting through regional country service reps to bring deep water specialized
service skills & equipment (from Texas) to the large deep water drillers
worldwide. They have been very successful in building these sales relationships
especially in Brazil.

The one item that caught my attention is their specialized Syntactic Foam
Flotation Products and their recent acquisition of Floatation technologies in
April 2008. This was a 100% stock transaction (hence the large no. of shares
outstanding 134 million and penny stock price).

After working several months with Flotation Technologies and the local
Brazilian service rep (Daslik do Brazil) a $5 million service contract was
obtained to provide a custom designed offshore deep water flotation system(s)
to Delba International a major supplier to Petr&#243;leo Brasileiro S.A (PBR).
The original deal was so successful that the company received several follow-on
orders for the other Delba drill rigs. Together with the previously announced
letter of intent for the Delba-3 rig, Deep Down now has orders for
approximately $18 million for their custom engineered deepwater marine drilling
riser flotation systems. This was all accomplished in less than six months!

The company had $19 million in revenues (from all divisions) in 2007 and so far
to date, Deep Down Inc., through their flotation division should match that
amount.

I have to give credit to Paul for finding this one and as with any penny stock
understand that one could loose 100% of their investment. This is a high risk
with a high potential reward. The stock is thinly traded. IMO the hidden jewel
in this business is the newly acquired Floatation Technology company. This is
one to buy and put away for awhile.

Flotation Technologies was recently certified to do business with PBR so the
new subsidiary had to meet some minimum "new company" standards. Therefore,
they pay their bills and it's a going concern.

On Tuesday, PBR signed $3 billion of new contracts with Transocean to lease
several deep water drilling rigs
(http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/5888689.html ). It's very
possible Deep Down Inc. (DPDW) could receive some new business from these new
drill rig lease contracts PBR signed. In any case, DPDW is one to watch
especially their Floatation Technologies Division.

E K S =re BDN:

Hi Spekulatius - Is it typical for these REITs to maintain a high debt ratio as
it provides them more leverage and better overall return? 

This works in good times, when the underlying assets appreciate.In bad times
the same logic applies in reverse,

 Or, have you noticed that over the typical real estate cycle, a good
management team will pay down more debt during the cycle bottom so they can
weather any prolonged downturn.

Good management will deleverage in good times not when they are with the back
against the wall. BDN did a questionable merger in 2005/2006 that provided them
the assets that they are now working so hard to get rid of. They also bought
back stock at around 30$, twice the current price, funded by debt.

I recently increased my BDN position after I read that they sold some
properties with the proceeds used to reduce their debt. These properties had
the largest vacancy rates (one piece was new construction now available in a
soft market). To me, I felt management was being conservative and took the
prudent path so they could weather any prolong down turn in this real estate
cycle.

What they do right (shedding assets) are the right things, but they still have
to put new funds to finish

 After the dust settles, I believe their net FFO will increase and their
overall portfolio debt will be less. 

No it won't. Shedding assets will not be accreditive to FFO. they recently
lowered they guidance and they will lower more
if they sell more assets.But they do not have a choice. if they do not
deleverage their cost of debt will go up and they will not be able to roll over
maturing debt to reasonable terms. Than it's game over and the debtholders are
running the show.

Grommit was it who previously introduced FFO/market cap as a key metric for a
REIT. I think it is an important metric but EV/EBITDA is even more important
since it a true leverage adjusted metric. FFO/market cap adjust for interest
payment but since money was so cheap back than that did not amount to all that
much. It was easy to increase FFO by increasing leverage when times are good.
but if overdone lenders are balking and raise interest rates and the credit
rating goes south if the assets depreciate in value.

Spekulatius good overview on the REIT analysis.

Is there typically good debt vs bad debt for an REIT to use? What should one
watch for as the company deleverages? I noticed that many of these REITs have
several different types of debt that range from preferred stock w/ callable
options, different flavors of bond financing and even floating lines of credit
pegged to adjust at the LIBOR rate.

What caught my attention for BDN was how they compared to their Peers for:
(1) EBITDA/Int. Exp
(2) EBITDA/Int + Pref Divs .

They seem to compare well in our low interest rate environment but as you
stated depending on the type of debt used (floating rate), they may have
significant exposure to future rising rates.

Dividend Yield (%) 12.41 5.31 5.42
UPREIT Market Cap ($M) 1,294.96 2,023.66 2,363.15
Total Capitalization ($M) 4,561.07 5,136.76 5,472.62 </pre>

In general, this is probably true for all REIT structured investments. It would
seem that a low risk management would try to use fixed rate debit instruments
with callable terms so long term debt could be paid down as excess cash is
obtained through periodic asset sales.

You mentioned "...<u>It was easy to increase FFO by increasing leverage when
times are good. but if overdone lenders are balking and raise interest rates
and the credit rating goes south if the assets depreciate in value. </u>..."

So even if real estate values STAY THE SAME and interest rates rise compounded
by the REIT having "Bad Debit instrument" (ie. floating Libor rates), the
"undervalued" investment all of a sudden do not look that attractive. The FFOs
decrease and the attractive dividend gets cut. Based on the chart above, it
should not be a surprise to see the dividend yield fall back to its peers.

Finally, the other "value" theme that attracted me to look at REITs was that
with the weak $US, U.S. real estate assets now look attractive to foreign
investors. There should be some minimum floor that these U.S. based REITs could
fall before a foreign investor would come in and buy them. I guess this would
only become a factor if we begin to see actual deals announced.

IAR, RHD. Funny to see that both stocks are quoted at exactly the same price,

You could be correct about TXN's ability or inability to maintain high roe

Interesting to me when comparing TXN numbers to INTC numbers. INTC also has
very little debt; lower roe numbers -- but more consistent than TXN. (TXN in
red back in '01 and '02.) Profit margins look okay for me as regards TXN and
INTC too. Anyway, I'm reducing my position in INTC a little--- In since 2/'06
and maybe I'm just getting tired of seeing the stock at that same price now.
(Of course, with stocks down in almost every sector, being at one's cost basis

Although I agree with author's critique of Jack Walsh's GE, I think that he
also grossly oversimplifies and overgeneralizes things. He's also enjoying a
lot of Monday-morning quarterbacking.

Manufacturing is far from dead in USA although it is clear that only parts of
it survived through the cheap oil transportation and cheap foreign labor era.
This was not some kind of Wall Street invention, it was economic reality of the
time.

The things are changing again and companies that will adapt for expensive oil
(and transportation) will flourish. Whether that will be US, Korean, Japanese
or Chinese companies and how many of them will manufacture in USA, remains to
be seen. Whether GE will sell its appliance business or not, whether these
appliances will be manufactured in USA or not is largely immaterial. If there
is a niche for high quality USA made appliances, it will be filled. If there is
not, other companies will manufacture something else here.

It is ridiculous to imply that some Wall Street wizards prevented US from
getting robotic appliances by now. If we are talking about real robots, nobody
in the world has them, since it is a very hard problem. On the other hand, a
lot of appliances nowadays have highly sophisticated processing units, based on
a lot of US intellectual advances in computers, chips, and so on. Dismissing
this as "number pushing" economy is ridiculous and insulting too. He even
mentions iRobot and MIT inventions himself, but then to fails to see that as a
positive thing.

I think this is a very opinionated piece. i do not agree with most of what the

of GE's earnings means that GE has grown much faster than the appliance market.
it may well be true that GE underinvested in this business but I do not
necessarily think that this was a wrong decision considering that they heavily
invested in other business with great results (aircraft engines for example).

Also he failed to mention that IRobot is struggling financially and that their
robot is more a novelty item than anything that most people find useful. I
doubt it is a multi-billion $ business in it's current form - they need

I agree with you that the robot cleaners is off-base. But I do believe that
often times economic realities are shaped by politics and Wall Street
invention.

I recently read the book China Shakes the World by James Kynge. Most of the
advances China made in manufacturing was done through reverse engineering and
the stealing of blueprints from the the subcontractors on projects. The first
Chinese motorcycle was an exact replicas of a Yamahas being sold in China. Most
of the heavy machinery plants that went under due to foreign competition in the
Mid-west were bought by Chinese companies for their blueprints.

In their quest for marketshare, US companies must cede a certain percentage of
the manufacturing process to domestic content. Currently the Chinese require
sixty percent of the their automobiles to contain domestic content.

Wall Street has played for short term gain while sacrificing long term
strategies of marketshare.

Do you know that Harley Davidson would have been history if the government
hadn't imposed tariffs on Japanese bikes in the seventies?

"In the early eighties, Harley-Davidson claimed the Japanese manufacturers were
dumping motorcycles on the US market. After Harley-Davidson rejected aid from
Japanese manufacturers, the US International Trade Commission imposed in 1983 a
45% tariff on imported bikes and bikes over 700 cc engine capacities
specifically to protect Harley-Davidson."

My point is that economic realities are often twisted and shaped by
governmental mandates and the desire for fat profits. Westinghouse sold their
nuclear division for CBS. Toshiba now holds 51 percent of Westinghouse, a
global provider of nuclear power in the global market. The prospects for
nuclear power certainly look brighter than what CBS has to offer.

You are right that skills can be developed over time. However, to be fair, he

money for your fund, then the chances of becoming one is very slim like he

Sure they are. I completely agree that having a great forward-looking
government is great. I also completely agree that having a great long-term
looking company management is great. And if you don't have one or the other,
you just have to go with what you have - or try to change it. ;)

Yes, China is protectionist and US is/was too. Again something that companies
have to deal with.

BTW, I mostly don't care about national ownership of businesses. Who cares if
it's Toshiba or Areva or Westinghouse who will build out nuclear plants in US.
If US has a market - and it certainly has - the plants will be built and
Americans will be employed. And there will be tons of companies building parts
for the plant that are American, Japanese, French, German, Brazilian, Russian
and Chinese.

On the other hand, surviving 20+ years of country's zero investment into
nuclear infrastructure for a private company is tough and I am sure
Westinghouse was better off without nuclear division. It's easy to Monday
morning quarterback now, but even in 2000 most people thought that
$15-per-barrell gas will be there forever and no nuke investment is needed. Now
realities have changed. Will that mean that US will get promising nuke startups
or company divisions? We will see. ;)

Spekulatius,

I don't agree with everything in the article, but I find it odd that the buyers
mentioned who are interested in purchasing the appliance division are Bosch,
Samsung, and LG. Somehow these mega companies think it might be to their
advantage to invest in this business.

Maybe GE became too enamored with financing, leasing and media deals that they
took their eye off the ball when it came to appliances. Certainly, they have
underinvested in the business and if you review the complaints about their
product, you can see why they might want to unload it.

http://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/ge.htm

I grew with GE appliances in my childhood house. Everytime we went to the
kitchen at night the little red GE symbol would be shining in the dark. How
much free advertising was this worth especially when their slogan at the time
which was "We bring good things to life." Perhaps I'm being too sentimental,
but maybe they should have tried to put that GE symbol in every global kitchen
as a way of cementing their image in the world. That's the power of a global

"Overall, GE has done the right move under Immelt."

Just a couple of more points about GE and then I'll give it a rest.

Jeffrey Immelt has been CEO since 9/7/01. He's had almost seven years to make
the company better. If you look at the chart investors have yet to invest their
money into his leadership. I believe the price is lower than the point at which
he took over. The last stock split was 5/05/2000. In the last five years his
total compensation has been over 72 million dollars. Has he earned his pay?
I'll let you decide as an investor in the company. Forbes rates him as one of
the five worst performing CEOs in 2007. (Actually he's number four on the
list.)

http://jbrooks4002.wordpress.com/2008/05/08/forbes-list-of-top-5-worst-performi
g-ceos-in-2007/

Even at these prices GE doesn't look like a particularly good value. At 21
times EBIDTA to enterprise value, the company isn't cheap. ROA? It's 2.1%. I
imagine LG, Samsung, and Bosch are planning to get a better return than 2.1%
from the appliance division if they purchase it.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=GE

Maybe GE is too big to succeed. One could argue that perhaps they should be
broken up and have their divisions spun off to investors. In fact, that case
has been made the last couple of years.

http://www.247wallst.com/2008/07/ge-going-for-pa.html

One positive note about Mr. Immelt. He's been a big buyer of the stock as it
has headed down. Certainly he believes in the company and he believes in
himself.

It may not look particularly good, though to me it looks good enough.
P/e at 12 is relatively low (hasn't been this low in more than ten years
(annual number)), p/sales is relatively low, roe is holding up, profit margins
are holding up, revenue is increasing double digits (latest quarterly report).
Company is restructuring to do better; dividend yield somewhat under 5% while
waiting. Checking other presumed value sites, some people seem to believe it's
a slow death stock of a behemoth company that they would not want to own under
practically any circumstances. (That means it could be a real value stock at

OT as a result of my reading more about short selling, i decided to send the
following emails to my rep. and senators:

"I am told that it is now sufficient for hedgefunds to merely locate stock
available prior to shorting it, as opposed to having a contract to borrow it.
This allows for multiple borrowing of the same stock. If this happened in any
other industry people would be prosecuted and sent to jail. On top of that the
"rule" that the sec just enacted protects a chosen few without reason. why is
the sec choosing to protect several foreign banks as well as goldman sacks but
not protect domestic banks under pressure such as Washington Mutual, Wachovia,
and NCC. this "rule" seems arbitrary and should apply to all stock in my view.
What is Congress and you specifically going to do about this? "

I usually believe in the free market but I think this is ridiculous. The SEC is
making a priority of protecting Goldman Sacks who probably does extensive naked
short sellling. The SEC is worthless at protecting investors. I think its time
to tell congress that this is important.

I hadn't seen that about Semgroup. It is very bad.

The parent's problems of possible bankruptcy apparently caught both my lp funds
unaware. Kayne Anderson being the #2 institutional holder and Cushing being the
#2 mutual fund holder, according to Yahoo. Then you have top firms like
Neuberger holding #1 position; Tortoise and Cohen & Steers in there too.
Insider buys - there have been many - up through May and no insider sales. So
there's been no foretelling of the quick demise of the company or parent.

Now media reports that the structure of these things and loan commitments to
banks are such that banks or others get special status reports on the business
that aren't made public. Which now lead to suggestions by the media that
there's insider trading on adverse news on this stock. The implication being as
well there's the possibility there could be insider trading in future or now on
other stocks that have such "secret" reporting requirements.

That presumably prudent investors or professional investors like those
mentioned above could be blindsided is very bad. Worse, when next time we -
when I - see stocks drop precipitously like Semgroup - instead of allowing that
it's panic and me wanting to re-look at the numbers, public reports, media
comments, or just hold on -- now I've got to consider the very good possibility
that the drop is all valid - supported by banking people or other insiders
trading on the additional secret knowledge they have. Something I wouldn't have
expected before Semgroup - (rapid stock descent, possible bk) - from stocks

which resulted in very heavy selling volume Thursday.

From the article"...By Thursday morning, however, something dramatic happened
as a stock that typically traded at a volume of about 68,000 shares daily was
transacted more than 5 million times. Much of that drop happened in the
morning, several hours before the Moody's report was released..."

I wonder how many other of these small oil service companies may run into
difficulties with future oil contract hedges. It's great when these hedges work
for you but can be a disaster when they go against you. There are always two
parties to these trades.

=============================================================
The finance officer for ULTR implemented a FFA hedge strategy for their entire
fleet for their bulk shipping division last year. It went sour when the future
bulk rates hit new highs earlier this year. The company had to book a major
loss for the last two quarters to unwind this hedge while all the other bulk
shippers were raking in the money from the high rates.

They should have just entered into longer fixed term contract leases, staggered
amongst their different ships.

Many of these smaller companies must be careful with these derivative option
products and not to over leverage their normal business operation(s) just to
obtain a bit more growth. I have noticed this occurring more frequently with
negative results.

Other than with Southwest Air, you usually hear about the blowups after the
fact as a footnote in the annual report.

the Semgroup disaster that took SGLP down (although i do not think that SGLP

NGLS is run by Targa Resources. This is also private equity and they have a
junky "B" credit rating. Their balance sheet looks ugly. Even though NGLS
balance sheet is above average for an MLP the concern I have regarding systemic
risk with the General Partner is too high for my taste and decided to sell NGLS

Sinoenergy, which I mentioned in the previous post, changed their symbol to

past quarter.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080721/cnm018.html?.v=37

Below is an excerpt.

Sinoenergy's guidance called for third quarter of fiscal year 2008, ended June
30, net revenues to be from $8 to $9 million and net income to be from $2.8 to
$3.2 million. The Company confirmed that its net revenue and net income for the
third quarter of fiscal year 2008 will at least be $10 million and $3.3 million
respectively. Reaffirmation of its guidance means year-on- year net revenue
grew at least 61.8 % and net income grew at least 69.2% compared to the
corresponding quarter in 2007.

Hi Paul - Added to my ERF position and sold my XLE. I bought XLE as a tracking
stock for OIL and integrated oil stocks but it has not performed that well. I
think the hedge funds and speculators trade this index and as a result it seems
to move more on speculation than on intrinsic value.

It is nice to have the dividend stream paid monthly from ERF and their growing
oil and natural gas reserves makes the intrinsic value of the company worth
more.

I am finding that I can do much better by buying individual company stocks than
buying the ETF equivalent sector shares.

==============================================================

I have been looking into foreign currency denominated bonds, specifically those
located in Australia and Brazil. I am trying to extend my foreign
diversification of stocks (w/ ADRs and Canadian Energy Trusts) into bonds. I am
looking at AAA corporate and/or Gov Agency short term bonds that are
denominated in other currencies w/ higher yields. The transaction costs are not
as high as buying stocks on foreign exchanges.

The value proposition is a better overall coupon yield and a small hedge for
the portfolio against a falling U.S. dollar. Three year Australian Gov. bonds
(that yield around 6.25%) look interesting but my Schwab bond team is still
researching my request.

Have you explored investing in foreign currency denominated bonds?

Goldman: Short WaMu Stock, Buy the Bonds
Posted by David Gaffen

Given the general reticence of analysts to issue “sell” ratings on shares,
suggesting that investors actively short a stock takes a negative outlook to
another level. Goldman Sachs analysts today told investors they should short
shares of Washington Mutual Inc.
wm_art_200_20080411115854.jpg
Shares of Washington Mutual have declined of late (WM, last 3 mos.)

However, they offset that position by recommending buying the company’s bonds.
Whereas the recent capital-raising activity dilutes the shareholders, it helps
bondholders worried about the balance sheet. Some of the $7 billion raised came
from convertible bonds, which convert at a price lower than the current share
price.

Goldman analyst James Fotheringham estimates that the struggling lender should
trade at a value equal to its tangible common equity which they estimate at
$9.84 a share; the stock is currently at $11.38 a share, down a few pennies on
the day.

He estimates the company has $17 billion to $23 billion of embedded losses in
its mortgage portfolio — of which just $3 billion has been absorbed.

However, in the same note, Goldman credit analyst Louise Pitt suggests buying
the company’s bonds and credit-default swaps, saying both indicators trade at
levels wider than their peers, particularly following the raise of $7 billion
in capital — including $5.5 billion in convertible preferred shares — to shore
up the balance sheet. The convertible shares can convert at $8.75 a share.

“The $7bn of new equity capital is a clear positive for bondholders,” she
writes. “We expect the convertible to become common equity later this quarter,
though we believe there is still a small risk that shareholders do not approve
the dilution.”

EKS. "I am finding that I can do much better by buying individual company
stocks than buying the ETF equivalent sector shares."

This is my preference as well. You can buy and sell the individual stocks as
they move - often independently of other stocks in their ETF sector. A little
more work to watch for such opportunities with the individuals, a little more
expensive with commissions on the several individual stocks; I hope though, the
end result is that I will do better going with individual accumulations than
with an ETF of them. (Brazil for example for me.)

Its been awhile since I wrote to the thread, but I got an letter in the mail
from Baron Funds some of you may be interested in. (If I remember correctly, I
bought up Baron Partners Fund when it became public and one investor bought
some).

Ron Baron has started a new no load mutual fund entitled "Baron Retirement
Income Fund". Its tagline is Fighting Infation for Retirees. The BRIF was made
public on June 30, 2008, although Ron Baron started investing his and his
family's money in it over 10 years ago, the same genesis as the Baron Partners
fund.

The annualized returns of the BRIF are:<pre>
01 year 00.60%
05 year 20.42%
10 year 10.51% </pre>

The goal of the BRIF is to invest in growth companies and seeks to provide
investment growth and income that oupaces inflation thus increasing its
investor purchasing power. This is a very different goal than a retirement
portfolio of bond funds. Where income is the main goal with no regard for
anything else. Baron goes on to state he will run the BRIF like a college
endowment paying investors a minimun distribution of 4% a year.

This is where you have to ask a lot of questions, like "What if the BRIF does
not earn 4% a year, where does the distribution come from?" I dunno. I am sure
that are tax issues, too. If you are interested, click

Historically, in almost every other time, the stocks have been better (higher)
on p/e, p/sales, p/bk.

I can't predict which, if any, of these stocks will be suffer further in
future, but I'm willing to bet a package of such stocks bought now will do okay
as time progresses. Reversion to mean.

Perhaps a difference in approach here. Some people need or want visibility
(understanding of future earnings prospects) for the companies that they are
now (in recessionary environment)buying. For me, I don't have much success in
being selective like that. Instead, I figure if I can bet on a diverse package

SGLP- Semgroups MLP affected by Semgroups bankruptcy. Semgroup is their 90%
customer but the assets should be useful for other customers as well:

KGS - fast growing midstream MLP from KWK. This is my replacement for NGLS.

AXP - Y2008 is a big writeoff, literally :-). I think Y2009 may be better and
at around 36$ it is finally cheap enough for me to jump in. Franchise value and
LT outlook has not changed for AXP unlike that of many banks. The US$ from Visa

WM - CS has a report about WM that looks reasonable. your numbers look like
they are from CS's report. CS report however is contingent upon WM making money
( in their operating business) which covers most of the losses while the
capital cushion covers the rest.

How much money WM makes is an open question if their credit rating is close to
junk. Sure they small depositors don't care since they are protected by FDIC up
to 100k$ but larger depositors will flee and other banks won't lend them
either.

Housing prices in CA are back to about Y2002 levels I think at least for
distressed sales that are plentiful. Lot's and lot's of prime mortgages and
home equity loans are under water. For that reason I do not believe Y2009 is
the bottom. The bottom set's in a while after home prices start to rise. Don't
underestimate drag in results in banking. I'd guess one year after the RE
prices bottom we will see better results for banks, not earlier - and the last

yes you are right its from CS. However one of the charts that WM provides notes
that something like 85% of their mortgage loans in california are coastal ones
as opposed to inland ones and that coastal prices have held up from better.
Also I not that even on the option arms a large number of mortgage buyers put
up at least 20% equity, I dont think such buyers are going to be so quick to
walk away, unless of course they subsequently took out helocs. None the less WM
will still have at least 20% downside protection. I expect coastal california
will recover pretty quickly relative to some other parts of the country. and I
just keep adding shares as it drops. If Im a foreign bank, I seriously consider
bidding $10 for wm right now, after accumulating good size positions in the
preferred and common at much lower prices. If Im a japanese bank maybe i buy it
set up a real estate division and start marketing second homes in california to
affluent asians.
Whoever gets it at that price is stealing, the beneficiary of the fraudulent
short sellers, and our incompetent government. What I wonder is, and Im
speculating that there might be as much as 30% additional shares out there now
that the company didnt issue is how that all washes out. How does the acquirer
separate out the real shares from the phony ones? or do the short sellers have
to pay even more than the offing price inorder to make sure they repurchase the
shares?
