FIT's business or the stock's trend line. It's one of those butts you have to

Jeffrey IMHO Polaroid is a perennial "poisonous dented can." I have no interest
in owning a Polaroid camera, people (including myself) now interested in
digital cameras, and being able to post photos on web, etc. The last time I
remember anyone use a Polaroid camera was to take a photo of my VIN on my car
for insurance purposes a year ago. Truth!

This cuts to the heart of why I am moving on to a growth investment strategy
vs. trying to figure out which "dented can" is OK and which are poisonous. IMO
an investment in Polaroid as a "value" stock (as opposed to short term trading)
requires you to disregard new evolution in technology (digital cameras,
lessening demand in high-end cameras have resulted in less expensive yet good
quality 35mm point and shoot cameras), and assume the status quo is going to
continue: "people will always want instant photography." IMO...instant
photography is a slowly dying business. If anything Polaroid is worth watching
as a short.

JMO. Best of luck, all.

Paul, I looked at FIT. While I see the yield as about as secure as a T-bill, I
do not see much to like about the business. They attribute their business
performance (declining sales and losses) to overseas competition in textiles. I
see this as more of a secular problem than a cyclical problem, differing from
the cyclical issues which made NH attractive for us earlier this year. What can
you envision to make this stock less cheap?

Jeffrey, re. FIT. "What to envision to make make the stock less cheap."

Well, that's possibly the heart of the net-nets for me. If I start to envision
an event that might occur, then I just automatically start to figure its
likelihood. I ultimately wind up concluding that I either can't scope it or the
specific likelihood is small. Therefore, I'd would avoid taking a position in
the stock. I'd never buy. So I try NOT to envision a specific favorable event
occurring that would improve the stock price. I just assume it will happen.
Which I believe is different from the Jim Clarke way, in which he does try
select stocks that also have good business prospects.

These net-nets work out (sometimes) as a 'reasonable return' (Not for somebody
who wants to give himself an edge by looking for possible 100% annual return
investments.) And on a statistical basis. Which means to me, on an overall
package of these type companies, enough favorable, unpredictable events will
occur to make the package profitable. (Ben Graham liked large companies, I
believe. But in today's market, the cigar butt pickings are smaller in size and
frequency.)

This is almost the same argument between value and growth. With a growth stock,
you see it, it's right there, there are positives all over the place. With
value, as MOO says, it's tough to separate the dented cans from the poisonous.
My observation, for me, is that I can't separate them (dented vs. poisonous)
when I find them. Therefore, I primarily have a package of value criteria that
both types fall into. The dented can profits outweigh the poison traps --
that's my expectation anyway -g-.

I see nothing to cheer about on FIT except the valuation, and that I get a rich
dividend to wait for something to happen. And that it trades at a discount to
its cash balance, and that it has $19 of "stuff" (net current assets + real
estate). What might happen? Maybe they liquidate. Maybe the family takes it
private like happened out of the blue with CIS six months ago (That one looked
just like FIT). Or maybe some smart young MBA from Nebraska buys a majority
position and then starts accumulating candy companies and insurance companies
with the cash flow. (That was enough for a 600,000% return in 30 years from a
little textile company called Berkshire Hathaway.

Bob, re. REITs, yes I still own HRP, and I agree that it appears to offer a far
lower risk of a dividend cut than SNH. You are correct that at 16%, it is
paying double the yield of other office REITs. That's because the stock has
slumped very badly after HRP spun off half of SNH.

I would be happier if HRP had spun off all of SNH. They blundered badly by not
doing so. They knew that the market was penalizing them for owning some nursing
homes, regardless of how few they were. The market, then as now, considered a
nursing home, however insignificant in comparison to the REIT's other holdings,
to be poison. Whether 1% or 99% of a REIT's holdings, a nursing home kills the
stock price. They knew that. So they should have gotten rid of them all. But
they didn't. They did a spinoff of the nursing homes into SNH, but retained
half of SNH. So, they still have the poison.

What you have in HRP is an office REIT, with a management that has two big
strikes against it: it blundered badly in its most important recent strategic
decision, and (as before) it is also beset by a conflict of interest that most
other REITs don't have. If I were given a proxy with a resolution to kick the
dummies out, I would certainly vote to do so.

Given my opinion of management, I find it difficult to recommend HRP to anyone,
regardless of how high the yield might be.

As a happy ex CIS holder, I like FIT too. They would more likely fold their
tents and pay off the shareholders than do an LBO. In CIS' case Weinstein had a
majority vote (class B) from the getgo. When he got disgusted enough with the
stock, that was the end of it.
FAB's Bitensky only owns ~28% and I imagine that the long suffering mutual
funds would raise hell if they thought the LBO was inadequate (some CIS holders
made similar noises but there were few holders of size).
Yes the textile business stinks, and isn't likely to get much better soon. If
they are rational (and you have to assume some self interest of most
managements) they will try to manage the business to minimize operating losses
and concentrate on the investments they own.
My most likely scenario is a gradual liquidation via the dividend, unless the
old man dies, in which case all bets are off.
I'm in this @ 11 3/4 (too impatient-g-) and look to buy more around 8-9. Looks

Good analysis of FIT.

I had a limit order in for weeks on CIS about two months before it got LBOed at
a 60% premium, but the market maker wouldn't hit my limit so I gave up over a
lousy sixteenth! You're right to compare the two. I actually did that in May
and decided to go with CIS at 4 1/2 rather than FIT at about 15 (if I recall
the prices correctly). CIS got taken out at 7 3/4, then I looked a month ago
and saw FIT at 12 1/2 and took a tiny position. Today at 10 1/4 I made it a
full position.

What I do like about FIT is first that the controlling shareholder is about 80
years old. If something unfortunate were to happen to the guy, the stock goes
up a lot, because that makes liquidation quite likely. And I also like the fact
that they don't reinvest in the business. It is a lousy business, they seem to
know that, so they don't gold plate their factories. As a result, the company
has been free cash flow positive for the most part. The cash flow statement is
much more important than the income statement for a net-net in my opinion. The
economics of the business have taken a turn for the worse in the last year or
so, but that may turn out to be a good thing if it speeds the decision to
liquidate.

And at 10 it pays me a 7% dividend to wait things out. The more I explain this
one, the more I like it.

So the Jim Clarke millenium net-net (or near net-net) fund now looks like this,
in order of preference. I own every one of these either professionally or
personally. There might be a couple of new names here - I forget what I posted
and what I didn't.:

When we do our picks for the new year in two weeks, these (plus CMH) are mine.

My plug for the holiday season is THQI. Not exactly a value play but a value
for what it offers- video game maker, excellent management, a low pe relative
to growth, and having a great holiday season in what is a boom year. It was
first sugggested by Paul Senior on this thread when it was in the high teens
earlier this year(equates to a post split price of about 12), at that time it
had lost the franchise for WCF wrestling which accounted for 70% of its
revenues. 1999 has obviously been a great year for the company it now has a 10
year franchise for WWF wrestling with an option to renew for 5 years. This in
partnership with JAKK. It has produced a new wrestling game which is the best
wrestling game ever developed and it is selling out as soon as it is coming in.
In addition they have additional video games such as RUgrats, Toy Story II,
Motorcycle Racing, so that this company is no longer a one trick pony. There is
also a large short position which I believed stemmed from, the anticipation of
the company losing the rights to produce its major product at the time. The
company has more than overcome this and I expect that sooner or later that
short position will be unwound.
It is a very strong company in a high growth market. This is currently my
largest position and IMHO deservedly so. I believe the current weakness in the
stock is related to option expiry, and I expect shares to rebound strongly in
the weeks ahead. Both the SI and yahoo threads are very active with many
channel checks especially this time of year. If anyone is looking for a growth
at a very reasonable price stock in their portfolio let me know. This is my

I assume you're comparing REITs to FIT. Fine, I own both. They are both exactly
what I am looking for at this time - things not likely to drop much if the
market plunges (and hell, if they drop so what - I know what I own here and it

Centex: I just took a position two days ago at 23 1/2 as it hovered near lows,

Then I sold today at 22 3/4. Yep, my "new lows" rule kicking in. I wonder how
low it will go. I may regret selling. But so far this year, all I know is that
I haven't regretted it even once when I've followed this rule in our beloved

What did I replace it with? For now, it's Crane (CR), which I bought at today's
high (18 3/8). Jim likes it, and Mario Gabelli just pitched it this morning on
CNBC. Great ROE and ROIC for its industry and at all-time low valuations. Its
cash flow is much higher than its accounting earnings. But the last time
valuations got this low the shares hit a 3 year go-nowhere patch (early 90's)
in which earnings hit a rough spot. There's also a spin-off coming up. It just
seems very cheap and very safe as a longer-term hold, out of which I'd expect

I understand your selling strategy on CTX and pushed this thread hard on
selling CHB. However, I think here you have to consider two factors. The first
is yearend tax loss selling.

The second is rising interest rates. People sell housing stocks in knee-jerk
fashion if you have an uptick AND if the trend is toward rising rates. I
frankly think we are far from any material impact on their results. To me this
means that you could have a large bounce anytime rates take a small dip.
However, as long ar rates are in a gradual cyclical uptrend, I think it will be
more of a trading stock than a long term investment. I'd start buying near
20-21 - 20% below insiders buying level.

Armin, additional comment on CTX. My price target is about 20 for a reason.
Looking at a long term chart, that looks like the right spot.
Furthermore, the chart suggests that the stock could rally easily to 30. At 20,
for an initial position, that is a 50% return in the one year time frame I
think it might take. (This kind of situation is one where I would modify my
100% in 2 years rule.)

On another subject, I do business with a small boutique firm that makes markets
in stocks. I heard today the observation that they are seeing a lot of small
sell orders - consistent, in my opinion, with
yearend tax loss selling. It probably pays to have orders in on any favorite
tax loss selling candidates a little below the market, if you can't watch
throughout the day.

re: CTX <<I would tend to prefer this to CMH as its industry is suffering
less.>>

I the words of our great president Bill Clinton, "it depends what the meaning
of the word is is". Clearly the market is anticipating that CTX is about to
suffer some pain, with interest rates rising. Can homebuilding get any better?
Clayton's economics are very different from Centex's. 50% of their income is
recurring, whatever the environment. Clayton is not recession proof, but it
suffers a lot less than a Centex unless I'm missing something big. Both may be
great investments, but if I have to pick one there is no question what that
would be. What did Centex do in the last recession might be a good place to
start. You might also look at what Clayton did in the last recession. I think
you'll see a difference. If you want to compare the valuations, I would suggest
you use mid-cycle earnings power, not trailing earnings which might very well
be the peak for both. But the mid-cycle adjustment for Clayton is much less
drastic than the adjustment for Centex.

Maybe the answer is none of the above. Time will tell.

Jeffrey, no offense, but the tax-loss selling is a given in stocks like CTX.
I'm ONLY looking to buy stocks that have had significant tax-loss selling. But
if they are making new lows to boot, then it's time to sell or sit on the
sidelines. There are plenty out there that have just sold down to support. The
only exception to this for me are the REITs, which have been so outrageously
overpunished, and which offer a logical place for the liquidity to move if the
market gets shaky (as they did last spring). Housing stocks and even my Crane -
when valuations got like this in the past it meant earnings tumbles for several
years and higher PEs while the stocks went nowhere. I agree with Jim's
assessment re: CMH and CTX. In fact, CMH looks like one of those certain stocks
suffering from tax-loss selling and yet not cracking old lows.

Jim, on CTX versus CMH, I think you may be right on fundamentals, that CMH
might be better. However, we are in the market to make money, and I believe
that CTX will jump a lot faster on any interim dips in rates. In other words,
if you are willing to take short term trading gain potential into
consideration, this may give the edge to CTX.

Next, if you look at Value Line, the average annual P/E for CTX is nearly
double current levels over a long stretch of years. Lastly, the builders never
acquired elevated P/E's in this cycle. The manufactured housing stocks did. Now
that we are being reminded that the MH stocks are cyclical, I am not sure where
their P/E's will settle for the next 5 years - possibly a lot lower than the
last 5 years.

Also, don't forget my CTX target is 20+ and we are nowhere near there now. If
it ever gets there I will certainly look at CMH.

<<Next, if you look at Value Line, the average annual P/E for CTX is nearly
double current levels over a long stretch of years.> [as compared with CMH]

Careful - think about what this means before you start making investment
decisions based on it. A lot of those CTX P/E ratios were on depressed "E".
CTX's "E" may be about as big as it is going to get in this cycle. Clayton has
never had depressed "E" in that time period, and I think there is a moderately
high probability they won't have it this time either.

We've done the CTX/CMH debate - my point here is on low P/E analysis. When you
are comparing a cyclical against a grower, you have to be careful what you are
comparing. Are we comparing CTX's P/E on its earnings BASED ON AN AVERAGE
MARGIN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS vs. a similar ratio for Clayton? Maybe we
should.

At the same time, NOBODY WANTS TO OWN HOUSING STOCKS AT ALL. Clayton may be the
chickens..t pick in the sector - I am not even trying to play the cycle - I've
owned the stock for three years and have added a little here and there during
this trough, and I intend to own it for a lot longer. You may be right, the
real money may be made in the highly leveraged housing stocks, but that's not
the game I'm playing. I know Clayton very well. I don't know CTX and TOL and
the other stickbuilders nearly as well. And as long as Clayton is at 9 and
change, I see no reason to spend much time learning them because I can't
imagine they'd be a better investment than what I have the opportunity to buy
more of.

What I do know about stickbuilders:
1) When they're all down, buy Crossmann at book value. Its there now.
2) Be very careful about debt levels
3) Understand land assets. In a recession the land may be worth half or less
what it is on the books for if they purchased it recently.

Au contraire, Mike, HRP is more a play on relative value TO the sector than

sector [Instead of 2x currently] it will have 50+% gain to supplement the 16%
yield. REIT pricing of office sector has already priced in the 'peak of cycle'
scenario, despite little evidence of the oversupply problems that generally
mark the peak of real estate cycles.
Today HRP confirmed the 1.28 annual dividend with these comments:
Commenting upon the dividend announcement, John A. Mannix, President of HRPT,
made the following statement:

"Although not reflected in the current trading price of our shares, 1999 was a
solid year of growth and improved operating results. The Board's declaration of
the fourth quarter dividend is intended to affirm our belief in the security of
our current cash flows.

"HRPT currently owns 192 high quality office properties located throughout the
United States. These properties are almost 98% leased. HRPT's largest tenant is
the U.S. Government which is responsible for almost 20% of our rental income.
About 50% of our total rents come from tenants that are investment grade rated.
The average remaining lease term in our office buildings is almost seven (7)
years."

Motors!).

Numerous value sages (Peter Lynch, Buffet) have recently suggested that energy

electricity supports a long bull market. While I consider the entire sector to

Its a fascinating stock because the track record is so clear, and the stock is

value with any precision, and Warren hasn't given out any signals that he
thinks it is undervalued (though I can't recall him ever doing so in the past

Wallace, seems like value investors can't get away from BRK.B. My take is that
most posters here see a value stock at a price point they've set. As Jim
alludes, some are buying now, some are waiting, some have bought @ 1500 range,
some bought higher than current price.

For me, I see no value buy either at current or lower prices. So I will turn
your post back onto you.

Wallace, why would you be putting this into an IRA? Short term, tax free trade?
Then you'd be expecting a bounce from the down trend? Long term hold? Then why
would you buy if you are concerned about WEB? (which is a valid concern, imo)

re: NAV. Why would YOU buy if the stock is higher than NAV? Jim, says some
smart people think actual value is much higher than current price. So there's a
potential bargain therein. But to me, that means that many not-so-smart people
have to come to the realization that the stock is undervalued. And value, for
this situation, is difficult to figure. I suspect difficult for you to figure
too. So if you bought the stock, you'd be relying perhaps on somebody else's
determination of its value? That could be dangerous imo, if so.

I have no issue that Mr. Buffett will do well when(if) the market crashes and
he is able to scoop up bargains for BRK and make that stock even more valuable.
But imo, that value will only be realized (BRK stock rise) as the stock market
recovers. I don't see BRK stock necessarily holding up in cratering market as
people exit positions or themselves try to scoop up the best bargains they see.
And the bargains that Mr. Buffett buys will take some time to work out and
increase that NAV, I'd guess.

Wallace, here's my opinion: If you've looked at and rejected 50 other
situations recently, and now this BRK is the best you see, and you intend to
keep it for a while (maybe a long while), then BRK is a buy for you. Otherwise
pass on it.

And of course, the only thing I know for sure is: all just my opinion and I
have been wrong many, many times.

I should have gone further - sorry. BRK is holding over $25 billion in cash and
bonds, and to my knowledge, Buffett is just sitting on that warchest waiting
for an opportunity. For now that is cash, worth a dollar per dollar. If the
market drops say 40% (that would be a nice start), $25 billion in Buffett's
hands is worth a lot more than $25 billion.

Why? Because the guy has shown over and over again that he is able to mint
money when there is panic selling. That is what he does best. I think what he
prays for before he goes to sleep every night is for another 1974, 1987 or
1932. And we've already got the prerequisite in place - a market overvalued by
50% or more. A mania on this scale is unprecedented in my reading of history,
at least in the last century. The times it got close to where we are now were
just before two of those three dates (1987 was nothing compared to the other
two). Buffett was virtually out of the market in 1973 and 1987. And he is now
as well. He's been right on his market calls two out of three times (and he's
only made those three), and my best guess is that it will soon be three out of
three.

Maybe he is shorting stocks, though I don't think he'd do that - he has never

Julian Robertson in Barrons today said that shorting a tech stock in 1999 was
like getting run over by a train that is going to derail a mile down the track.
I can feel that in my gut, and in my wallet. That people as smart as Julian
made the same error makes me feel a little better. Not much, but a little.

But I have learned my lesson. I'm going to make it all back next year with my
new insights into the market. Since now we know tech stocks only go up, I know
where I want to be for 2000. But these guys buying Cisco and AOL shares are the
really dumb ones in my opinion. Because there is a much better alternative. Do
you realize that you can buy call options that allow you to make 300% even if
the stock moves only 40%? I'm selling my Elder Beerman and Clayton Homes and
FAB Industries into options on AOL, CSCO and QCOM. Can you imagine how rich I
am going to be next year?

Enough of buying things for less than they're worth. I want to make money.

Yes, this is sarcasm, but I've heard this from quite a few people in the last
couple weeks and have been absolutely horrified. Relatives of mine who have
employed very conservative investments strategies up to now asking me "what do
you think of Qualcom?" And I tell them and they just zone out. Or even worse
ask me, "How about Yahoo?" The stake in the heart though is when they say "But

I don't know where the top is, but I can smell it from here. (And I know I have
said before I can see the top, and have been wrong. But I can see a lot farther
than I can smell.)

Everybody says you can't time the market, and I agree with that under normal

Jim,

I'd agree with you that a lot of the new nifty-fifty and internet stocks are
ridiculously valued. Having said that, has there ever been a bear market
without a recession and/or either inflation or deflation? I remember Marty
Zweig's book, Winning on Wall Street, written around 1987, I think, saying that
it took inflation, deflation, or Dow or S&P (can't remember which) P/Es over 20
to precipitate the Bear, but it seems he's forgotten his own advice and been
bullish as the magic 20 number has been overtaken these last several years. And
he's been right.

What happened to bring about the last bear markets? 1990--there was a
recession, I think. 1987: Guess you could say that was overvaluation, but a lot
of people call that a big correction, since it didn't last very long.
Precipitated by Jim Baker as I recall. 1973-74: Oil crisis. Any precedent for
this market to crash?

Another thing to remember is that the average p/e of a Value Line stock is
something like 15, which isn't exactly nose-bleed territory. Of course, that
only includes stocks with earnings, and I suppose you could argue that the
non-earning stocks skew the results.

One other thing to think about is the fact that only 28% of NYSE stocks were
above their 200 day moving averages as of a couple weeks ago, which means we
could be having or have had another stealth bear market similar to the one a
few years ago.

My stock pick for 2000 is WSP.V, a stock I've owned (unprofitably) for 3 years.
It's a Canadian diamond stock trading around C$2.20 that should have the 2nd
diamond mine in Canada in 2002 if things go on schedule. It's trading at a huge
discount to its NPV which Deutche Bank estimates as $12-$15 or higher (at one
point in the DB report the analyst suggests $25 or more is not unreasonable).
They own 68% of a minimum of 16 million tonnes of kimberlite rock worth US
$200+ per tonne (the deposit is open in 3 directions). They're covered by
analysts at DB and Canaccord Capital. Of course, if the market crashes I don't
think people are going to be buying diamonds, so I'll be screwed.;-)

Perhaps you should combine your strategies- short the internet stocks and buy
calls at the same time!
OT: The last stock I reccommended on this thread THQI is looking like a falling
knife. Dropping 1-2 points everyday since I reccommended- I wonder if its
picking up new tax-sellers on a daily basis? I guess I should have said buy
this on December 30.

Good question. One can imagine that if more traders wish to take advantage of
the January effect, the buying will begin earlier each year, eventually pushing
it into December. In fact, for the past few years it has done just that.
Furthermore, some think that it is rapidly becoming a self-destructive event as
more people attempt to profit from it. Personally, I've seen some decent gains
in January from my small caps who had a heavy December tax selling season, but
I've never tried to take profits from it. Not my style. Besides, January is for
snowmen, not stockmarkets.

Ho, ho, ho. That's my secret. I look for different types of support. My entry
price usually is chosen with a defined maximum (but minimal) loss, based on
where support for the stock is. Hey, it's technical analysis, and probably not

Hi Wayne, Re: FR

I bought this during the last economic downturn when Merrill Lynch brought it
to market. I sold it a couple of years ago around $36. When I owned it the
management was doing a good job and gave me some nice non-taxable income.

I like to buy reits during a recession when the street does not want anything
to do with them and rents are dirt cheap.

What percentage is taxable as a general rule? Some of the payout comes from
earnings which I assume would be taxed.

I assumed that was the case because the depreciation and earnings ratios vary

is taxable and the depreciation portion is not?

Wayne,

First of all the dividend they send is taxable and the news releases you see is
all dividend pay out. I would have to go back to my records which are not
stored here to see what the non taxable pay outs were. As I recall I was
getting 20% to 30% over and above the dividend which was not taxable. This non
taxable pay out depends on the assets and the schedule of depreciation they
have set up when the properties were purchased.

IMO the large factor when investing in reits is what is the management paying
for new properties. If they are paying top price for the new properties the
return on investment goes down as the rents go down. I started investing in
reits during the RTC crises. I went to the Library and found a couple of books
that had models to evaluate the assets. I can not remember the names of these
books, but there were only a couple of books on this subject.

Thanks Joan.

I'm new to RIETs. I wasn't aware of the potential payout over and above the
dividend.

I vaguely remembered reading about certain special tax issues but I assumed
that the dividend was totally taxable.

When you brought up the non-taxable distributions I started jumping to
conclusions about the dividend. Thanks for getting me back on track. I'll look
for a few books on the subject.

Not sure I'm correctly understanding the conversation between FR- the specifics
regarding the taxability of its payouts vs. the general taxability of REIT
dividends. I don't know anything about FR regarding an "additonal" payout which
is a return of capital. My experience in holding a bunch of other REITs is that
the quarterly paid out dividend is what you get, there's no additional amount
given out as a non-taxable, return of capital. In other words, the dividends
declared and paid include both the taxable and non-taxable portion (if there is
a non-taxable amount). Sometime before April 15, a letter goes out to the
stockholder from the REIT which indicates, for each of the year's prior
quarterly dividends, what percentage is to be considered taxable and what
percentage non-taxable.

What I am trying to say is that if someone invests in REITs and thinks they are
going to get more cash back than what is stated by the dividend, that is not
correct-- at least in my experience. There's no "extra". But some of that cash
you get is usually (depending on the specific REIT) not taxable.

My understanding is that the full dividend (tax. plus non tax.)is declared on
Schedule B with the non-tax, return of capital portion then deducted on the
appropriate Sched. B line. Also, because it is a return of capital, this non
tax. amt. must be deducted from one's cost basis when one sells the stock. Of
course, I am giving my totally unqualified opinion here. I defer to you CPA
experts regarding tax matters.

Once again, I'll recommend Richard Barron and his SI REIT thread as a very good
source of knowledge, information, and support. Here's a REIT book that was
recently mentioned there:

I2, re. RPM. Looks to me like all the specialty chemical makers are at
multi-year lows. Yes, RPM is on my watch list still. And when it broke 10 (it's
up to 10 1/2 today), it seemed like a very good buy - getting a 5% div. yield
on a company that may have the best record on the NSYE for dividend (and sales)
increases. I just could not step up.

I'm just wondering if there is a sea change with these type investments. Very
unusual isn't it, to have so many good companies with these good records
selling at such low prices? And we're not in a recession; nor does it seem that
the sales, earnings of these companies are going down in '00. (I'm thinking
about GPC here too.)
Money is being sucked out of these stocks and funds diverted from going into
them, by the enormous interest in internet related stocks, imo. At this point
it looks to me like it's impossible to get anyone interested in stocks like
RPM. (although, that just might be my unbalanced perspective at the nadir)
Maybe it will take a 6 or 8% dividend yield. Or a cataclysmic event. There are
so many of these good companies and good stocks available at attractive prices,
that EVEN I have a tendency to say, wait, let's look around, let's see if we
can do better. For RPM - with a high pe and high p/book (relative to the
cheaper stuff out there), because everything about it doesn't look perfect, it
just seems easier to pass on it in this kind of market. That's imo, but since
it's just you and I who are carrying the RPM discussion, I'll suggest that
other thread value investors pretty much have made up their minds similarly.

FWIW, adding to my ALLC position again today.

I like these investment company stocks. Too bad I wasn't ever smart enough to
buy CMGI though. Anyway... ALLC with a near 9% dividend yield and a very good
long term record of performance (assuming one reinvested the dividends) should
do okay if it can continue its winning ways. IMO.

Aside: Wallace R.: this stock could be looked at to check for suitability for
somebody who wants a "surrogate mutual fund in an IRA". Again, jmo, I'm not
qualified in any way to give an opinion, and what's worse...I've been wrong

Paul,

Thanks for the input. I'm going to buy a book on the subject.

My intuition on the subject was you got the dividend and it was taxable.

The fact that a portion of the dividend is usually cash from operations other
than earnings (depreciation or other) combined with my vague recollection of
special tax circumstances for REITs (plus input from others) made me think that
perhaps the non earnings portion is not taxable and the earnings portion is.

I need to clarify all this.

Well, James, I jumped in with both feet on EBSC today in the late day selloff.
My reasons are as follows:

(As of 10/30/99, shares outstanding of 14,934,000)

Book value - $15.31 per share (before Q4 earnings of perhaps $.70)

Current assets less all liabilities ("net-net") - $7.60 per share (before Q4
earnings)

Price/sales - 11%

Earnings per share (1999) - $.70 estimate

Cash Flow per share (1999) - $1.70 estimate

November same store sales - +6.5%

$24 million buyback authorized - 1,118,000 shares purchased for
$7.3 M as of 11/18/99 (avg $6.53) - leaving $16.7 M, which would buy
3,340,000 shares more at $5, under the existing authorization.

If they were able to buy 3.34 M more shares at an average $5, and adding in
rough earnings of $.70 for Q4, shares O/S would go to
11.594 M, book value to about $19.19, and net-net to $9.25.

The numbers speak for themselves. The point of the preceding paragraph
is to point out what will happen to the values if the stock languishes
at this price level - we will end up on the current buyback authorization at
26% of book value and 54% of net-net.

If this is not a great value, I don't know what is. As with you, it is number
one on my value parade. I don't have a number two. I also think this makes at
least 3 of us to buy on our thread.

Disclosure - decent-sized position, average cost $5.12

I have only one question. If this is as great a value as it appears on paper
why aren't the insiders who are making hefty salaries- the 37 year old CFO is
making over $500,000 a year, jumping with both feet to buy as you are? Total
insider sales past 6 months are a paltry 4,000 shares. Color me suspicious. If
I am wrong and there has been significant insider buying that I am unaware of
please correct me.

Good point, Armin. Management owns about 360,000 shares outright (from the
latest annual proxy). I suspect two significant reasons for lack of recent
purchases are:

1. There have been a number of 13D's filed over the last year or so by folks
who expect action to be taken to create shareholder value. As such management's
jobs might be considered less secure than usual, which would certainly inhibit
me from buying stock if I were one of them.

2. In connection with a different company also having an active buyback I was
told that insiders could not buy while the buyback was going on, as they would
be competing with the company. Assuming that this is correct, it would
certainly apply here, where there is a massive buyback underway.

This certainly is not a tech stock and this valuation does not come with a
Walmart quality company. I am looking for 50% sometime within the next year,
with limited downside risk. Long term, if the stock does nothing, cash flow
(plus perhaps the sale of a few assets) would enable them to eventually really
cut the shares outstanding a great, and put the per share values on a parabolic
curve upward.

Jim, care to add anything?

Wayne, congratulations on having some of your ideas and hard work recognized in
the Motley Fool column.

The column's author, Mr. Tilson, built the argument that being fully invested
was wrong if not dangerous, and that J. Siegel was wrong (in his book, which
concluded that investors should stay fully invested.) But then Mr. Tilson
admitted that he himself has been fully invested (successfully) in the past and
was likely to remain so. I just do not understand that kind of dichotomy -
between one's actual actions and one's making the effort to build a case for
advising other people into a contrary action.

(But I enjoyed reading the Buffett and Crimi parts)
