Paul - I still haven't sold 1 share of CSBK - it pays .20/annual div - between
their stock buyback & coming up on 2nd year anniversary of ipo - & longer term
rates going up - i have to believe they can capitalize on the fact they're
trading way below book & profitable - but i've been holding since mar '04 - &
I'm just going to hold

- on the other 3 banks i recommended - ABBC, KRNY, & OSHC - all have recovered
but not up that much - & I sold some of each

- also - my near 100% winning record only applies to value stocks - & only over
the long haul

re CSBK, OSHC and ISBC
The 14M$ is the correct number, the shares in the MHC do not count since they
are not issued yet, but they will be at some point in the future - the
secondary will happen at the going stock price then and proceeds will flow to
the company itself.

This applies to CSBK as well as OSHC and ISBC - all three banks are S&L with an
MHC structure. Compared to OSHC and ISBC i like CSBK much less so because of
their low earnings power and growth.

CMCSA and DTV -
CMCSA might be OK based on the value criteria, With respect to Comcast's "huge
FCF" , i consider "huge" relative a number. With it's current market cap the
FCF yield is less than 5%, which is OK but not extremely cheap. With the heavy
debt load, there is also a risk that higher interest rates may hurt.

I admit that DTV's metrics look worse than CMCSA's in some respects. FCF and
earnings just turned positive and are still moderate, but i think they should
be able to earn a FCF of 500M$ this annualized - however while Comcast
subscribers are stagnant DTV will add about 1.2M subscriber annually. With an
acquisition cost of more than 600$/subscriber (which is expended right away
contrary to DISH, which capitalizes the cost!) that's at least 600M$ in
expenditure that would go away of DTV's subscriber # were to remain constant.
In other words, DTV should see a gusher of cash if growth starts to slow and
with net cash on the balance sheet i suspect that shareholders should be
rewarded with dividends and buybacks. Also on a EV/subscriber valuation beats
the Cable stocks by far and DISH by 20%. I acknowledge that the cable companies
have the better pipe for value added service but i don't care as long as DTV
and DSIH continue to gain subscriber with old fashioned TV.

Anyways, i am in for a starter position and not opposed to add more.

Spek,

- thanks for confirming that mhc shares shouldn't count against the total shs
o/s - at least not until they're issued

- ISBC has better earnings than Clifton. But if you read the 424's - concerning
real estate owned - you'll see that for ISBC - per pg 103 - they lease about
2/3 of their branches - so no real hidden value here

- vs. CSBK - they’re probably sitting on millions of $$’s of real estate - as
they own 8 of 10 offices - most purchased around 1975 - so when/if these banks
are taken over - clifton is 2 years earlier out of the gate - & could be the

Hi Suma - Buffet recently unloaded two-thirds of his stake in cable firm Shaw
Communications Inc.. This was in September 2005. He also bought more Comcast in
February 2005 (he upped his current stake by 3%).

I used to be a DISH subscriber for six years and then Comcast upgraded my
street with broadband. I would never go back because I now have VOIP (Voice
over Internet phone), Internet and Cable. Comcast has a lot of new emerging
services they will be offering specifically VOIP and some type of cellular
wireless phone service (rumor is a partnership bundle with Sprint).

That is not to say that SBC (which is now AT&T new) can not compete. They
currently provide a bundled service with DISH but soon will be selling their
own cable type service using VOD (Video-on-Demand).These companies provide much
more than traditional old style "cable TV".

I think DVT and Dish are limited in the scope and distribution of "services"
that one way satellite transmission provides. It will be interesting to see the
subscriber growth numbers in five years especially as many of these new
emerging technologies get installed on the SBC and COMCAST systems.

Finally, it looks as though Comcast is increasing their rates from 3%-6%
beginning 1/1/2006. Another jump in their free-flow-cash-flow.

It's hard to find a true value play in this sector.

Recent Activity.

I took a full position in First Marblehead (FMD) with an average cost of $29. I
sold some at $35.

I took a full position in PlanetOut (LGBT) at around $8. This is the leading
gay media company in the world with a market cap of $150 million. Its
properties include gay.com ... probably the highest profile gay website (Alexa
ranks it 917th among all websites), the Advocate, Out, and planetout.com.
Revenues are growing pretty rapidly. The stock is not cheap, but I think it's
okay given what I think is the probability that it will become a billion dollar
company over the next decade. The company has begun to serve international
markets, but there's plenty of room to grow.

I started a position in JoAnn Stores (JAS) with an average cost now of $14.65.
The company is an arts & crafts retailer that is undertaking a superstore
conversion which is producing mixed results so far. I think the price reaction
is overdone. Price to Sales is around .15, but they do have some debt.

I have a large position in Cryptologic (CRYP), an online gaming company, with
an average cost of $17.65. ROA is 16%, ROE 28%, forward PE around 14, revenue
has more than doubled (organically, I think) over the last three years, and the
company has a lot of cash.

I started a position in Estee Lauder (EL) at $30. Forward PE is around 16 for a
pretty high quality company.

I started a position in FTD (the florist)at around $11. This an IPO of a recent
LBO. I believe it's one of the top 2 floral distributors in the country where
there is a big dropoff to #3. The forward PE is around 13. There is a lot of
debt, but I think the company will be able to pay it off: they are putting up
double-digit revenue increases.

I started a position in Pegasus Solutions (PEGS) at $7.18. The company
"...provides technology and services to hotels and travel distributors." What I
find intriguing about PEGS is it has a near monopoly position as a "switch" to
the GDSs. A lot of hotel reservations come through a switch instead of
accessing the GDS systems directly. I believe PEGS has the more dominant of two
switches. The company does not appear to be well-managed and there is takeover
interest in it among holders that paid in excess of $10/share. It's trading
near a 5 year low.

I re-entered Pfizer (PFE) around $21 after selling at a loss at $26. The
forward PE is around 11.

I re-entered UST (UST) at around $38 after selling at large gains at $45. UST's
yield is in the high 5s and the PE is around 12.

I added to Wal-mart (WMT)... my average cost is now $47.

I sold H&R Block (HRB) at a slight loss. The commission's proposal to simplify
the income tax system makes a lot of sense to me. The probability that Congress
would enact this is remote, but I think the impact on HRB would be devastating
if most people could have the postcard or one-page tax return, so I'd rather
watch on the sidelines.

I sold School Specialty (SCHS) lots purchased in the $20s at $48.76. I have not
re-entered after their sale fell through.

I sold Cadbury Schweppes (CSG) at $42 (purchased mostly in the $20s). I very
much like the changes they have undertaken, but the history of this company
inspires some caution.

I sold Valero (VLO) at $92 and Conoco Philipps (COP) mostly because I don't
want to be on the receiving end of MTBE litigation against refiners.

I will finish selling off all my REITs accumulated in 2001-2 in January.

- Brendan - on your list - i’d give HRB another look:

- H&R Block is projecting 2006 earnings of $1.90 to $2.15 - they pay $.25/share
dividend or about 2% yield on the $25.26 stock - multiple parts to this company
- per confer call & last earnings announcment - they’re trying to increase
profits, grow new business lines, hold down costs, etc... sounds like they’re
achieving growth in certain lines w/out profits - for instance - they now have
985 fin’l advisors & cut their qtrly loss to $8 mill in that line of business -
during qtr - HRB repurch 4.6 mill shs @ avg. price of $27.98 - that’s over 1%
of the 326.1 mill shs o/s diluted - but its part of a larger stock buyback
program

- H&R Block has a huge following of people who use their tax services - both
walk-in & TaxCut for PCs - they’re in Sears, Walmart, etc... both co-owned &
franchised stores - & then they convert many of these filers into customers of
their other investment & mortgage svcs - & they’re applying for a bank licensee
- they’re growing their RSM McGladrey public accounting franchise - & if you
know anything about Sarbanes Oxley - this division should continue doing nicely
for the forseeable future - per confer call - they’re planning on opening 1,000
new points of presence in 2006 - that’s a lot of expansion costs weighing down
profits now - also attempting to reduce orig costs by 50 basis points - also -
for full-yr 2004 - deprec & amortiz was $183.9 mill - & they have over $1 bill
in goodwill alone - so these non-cash charges will weigh on earnings but will
allow H&R Block to continue their buyback, dividend, & increase equity -
provided overall profits are maintained - HRB currently @ $25.26 - good luck

Hello all,

I like the back and forth on Comcast. It does look like an interesting play.

I currently have Comcast Cable + Broadband and have been very satisfied with
the service. But, the one risk I see in their business plan (and all Cable
Broadband companies) is the coming roll-out of free wireless internet across
the nation. I realize it's in its infancy, but my county is testing free
wireless in several cities (and I'm not in San Francisco, but in the Mid-West)
through the end of the year, and I'm betting I'll have free wireless before
June of next year. Now, I'm uncertain if Comcast is involved in supplying the
'pipes' for all the free access that will be given, but even if Comcast is
involved and is getting some sort of fee for having the pipes, I can't imagine
they're able to make as good of profit margins. In the worst case, they're not
involved at all and their $49.99/month Cable Modem service is at risk.

And even though I love Comcast and On-Demand, once free wireless hits our town,
I will seriously shop around for a better rate on cable TV service because the
main reason I'm with Comcast is their Cable Modem Broadband service.

Comments?

Thanks,

CW

Hi Chilly - You make some very good points. The rumored partnership with Sprint
is for COMCAST to deliver WI-MAX & Wi-FI services that integrate with a
seamless VOIP service. The gaps in the service coverage would be filled w/
cellular provided by Sprint. It's hard to find a pure play let alone a value
proposition in this sector. Perhaps there are some hidden assets in the owned
spectrum that WI-Max requires. I believe Sprint & Verizon has secured the
needed frequencies to build such a national wireless system.

Sprint, Comcast: 'Quadruple Play'
http://www.thestreet.com/stocks/media/10250807.html

From the article:"...The companies will work to develop converged next
generation products for consumers that combine the best of cable's core
products and interactive features with the vast potential of wireless
technology to deliver services anywhere, anytime....".

The value proposition may be in owning the company with the best "pure" Free
Flow Cash Flow, hidden assets (patents, licenses and/or franchises) and overall
growth potential.

Two of my better "Value" purchases in the telecommunication sector are NOK
(Nokia) and GLW (Corning). Both companies have rebounded significantly from
their recent lows. I loaded up on NOK last year at around $12 and have a price
target of $22. What is interesting is that the CEO said that their next killer
application will be the mobile phone that delivers TV. So maybe the real play
is with the content producers. Disney comes to mind.
http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=12715&hed=Comcast%2C+Sprint+Alliance+S
en
Comcast, Sprint Alliance Seen - World’s largest cable operator seeks to repair
chink in its armor with Sprint wireless deal.
From the article:"...In an MVNO, a company like Comcast can offer wireless
service carrying their own brand, relying on the network provided by a wireless
carrier. Sprint announced an MVNO with Disney just last Wednesday (see Disney
Plans Cellular Service)....".

I believe Paul Senior has discussed DIS and they may indeed be the best value
play at this time.

I continue to watch all of these companies and if a significant buying
opportunity presents it's self, then I will add shares to my current positions.

OT question, maybe someone can point me in the right direction.

I am trying to automate my system of tracking the interesting stocks. For that
I need to a capability to automatically update some company data in Excel
spreadsheet as it changes. For example, instead of inputting market cap of a
company by hand, I would want to get its market cap updated automatically from
web.

Is there a good web URL that spits out only the market cap of the company given
its symbol? Preferably in numbers only. For example, yahoo.com is not good,
since it throws a whole page of HTML at you (e.g.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ibm ). Even worse, this page is formatted
differently depending on whether you are logged in or not. Even worse still,
the market cap is given as 141.67B - the B letter messes up Excel, so I would
need to write some VB script to process the number before using it.

Alternatively, has anyone written a spreadsheet with VB macros that fetch the
data from some source and processes it so that just the number remains.

Or maybe you know the forum, where I should ask this. :)

Madharry, I have some L and spin offs. I've been adding just a little as L has
dropped below 8. According to articles in Fortune and BusinessWeek, company is
undervalued. Mr. Malone & staff apparently having difficulty realizing fair
value without incurring very large capital gains taxes.

My favorite stocks for buy recommendations are the stocks I've most recently
bought. They're the one's I'm most enthused about and have most recently looked
at. Also, that I've recently bought a stock means I likely found it a better
buy opportunity for me than any of the other many,many, many stocks I already
own and didn't add to. HOWEVER, there's no correlation between my enthusiasm
for a stock and my success with it. Also, since I buy mostly on downtrends, my
most recent purchases often continue to perform poorly right after my buys.

Given that I don't know your requirements, other than looking to see what I and
others have bought for our own requirements and seeing if any of these picks
might be suitable for you, the only other suggestion I have for you would be to
maybe check out a similar gaming stock to replace the one you sold - UBET

re CSBK - i acknowledge that CSBK has more undervalued real estate in it's book
than ISBC and OSHC, but i am not sure how much it should matter. Since all
those stock conversions trade below book effectively anyways earnings and
growth are more important to me.

CSBK for example has barely grown their balance sheet since they went public,
they are way overcapitalized, earnings are weak and they do not seem to know
how to put the IPO proceeds to any productive use. OSHC for example is growing
more, they are building new branches and earnings/share are twice as high as
CSBK. So, i think the latter is more likely to build shareholder value and

re PFE - reentered my previously sold position at 20.54$ just before the
announcement of an increased dividend. With a 4.6 yield, PFE is now pretty
interesting for an income investor. I like the fact that PFE is managing the
business for cash rather than growth - the FCF yield should be around 8% -
enough to pay the increased dividend and to invest some funds back into the
business. With the arms race in sales now gone (most pharma companies are
cutting back their sales force after many years of adding) I see that cost
reduction could drive earnings more so than sales increases.

I'll take losses and close BUD position. Constellation Brands has dropped in
price, and I'll take a few shares now.

BUD should work out okay - it's so dominant in the US market and has such good
financial numbers. At current price, a buyer can get the stock under what
Warren Buffett started his position at, I am guessing. And who wants to bet
that Mr. Buffett's wrong?

OTOH, it might take some time and patience for BUD to work out. The beer market
shows at best lackluster growth. More and more people seem to be switching to
spirits or wine. I notice more television stations with ads for hard liquor.
Given the many brands that STZ has, it would seem that the fashion favors STZ.

STZ doesn't have anywhere near the good financial numbers that BUD can put up,
but it does show better sales growth. If the beer market does okay, I expect
STZ's Corona to participate. An improvement in BUD's fortunes, doesn't mean to
me that STZ's sales and earnings must consequently suffer. I'll guess that if
STZ can manage its acquisitions, doesn't overpay for future ones, and can
operate its far-flung empire, the stock ought to be able to increase back to
new highs.

Madharry, just guessing I'll be able to reenter BUD near current prices. And
yes, I'm looking for capital losses and have also closed a stub BUD position in
a small Roth account.

Everybody who follows Buffett - all the value players - are now in, so I
suspect the company will have to have a catalyst event for the stock to move
much further. Perhaps an acquisition or some dividend or larger buyback. Hard
for me to see any surprise upside in earnings - sales seem stalled, company
already has 50% of the beer market, and remaining competitors are large and
fierce - fighting over what now seems to be a diminishing demand.

Normally, I'd try harder to wait it out - company and stock will eventually
return to favor - just that STZ captures my fancy with its varied product
lineup and acquisition-oriented management.

Paul -

I recently entered the booze business as well (a great, though boring, business
to be in BTW). My approach was to buy an entry: 3 parts BUD, 3 parts DEO, 2
parts STZ. I found it easier than trying to game each one individually. The
slightly lower weighting for STZ has to with their dependence on acquisitions
(or, to put it less kindly, rollups) and the resulting uncertainty. If you're
looking at booze, DEO should definitely be on the radar - also a Berkshire
holding and in many ways the most reliable of the three.

Both EXPE and TSG have been doing well. This is a company specific issue and CD
is just not executing. The idea to split up the company just after acquiring
Orbitz at a premium to market value is just dump and destroys shareholder

Mark Marcellus. Okay, I will look further at DEO and at least put it on my
watch list.

I glanced at it briefly a couple weeks ago. They're having some problems with
Guinness - sales dropping as pub consumption drops due to cigarette smoking
bans. Perhaps the drop off is temporary.

Another thing for me was that I did see somewhere where Buffett might be buying
DEO stock recently, and I found that odd and somewhat hard to believe. Because,
a couple years ago when he visited Europe, the media were rife with rumors that
he was going to make an offer for DEO (all of it). So if he didn't buy shares
then (Nothing was publicly announced that I saw.), and if the stock was around
$40 or maybe $45 then, why would he buy now with the stock near $60. (This is
my opinion - possibly I've got dates, prices, etc. all wrong.) I just figured,
I misread that he was buying now.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=DEO&t=5y

Here's though where I see now a BusinessWeek report dated last week where
Buffett or his surrogate have bought DEO:

http://yahoo.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_49/b3962084.htm

Not sure if I would call DEO a value stock. However, I'm not surprised it might
be a stock Mr. Buffett would like at current price. The p/e (now 17+, forward
maybe 14+ ) is high, imo, for a food company. OTOH, I believed a p/e of 14 was
too high for Kraft when Mr. Buffett bought it, and I was wrong (The company was
sold at a big profit for Buffett.) I know or highly suspect that Buffett likes
food companies (and wines - and Guinness for sure - are food products, right?
-g-).
DEO offers a decent dividend and great profit margins. That's diminished
somewhat by the high price you pay for each dollar's worth of DEO's sales.

------
DEO and STZ operate in the same space. If people listen to Cramer, he usually
touts buying what he calls "best of breed". My opinion is we want to be right
when we pick something within a sector - we want the stock to go up, preferably
more than any other stock in the sector that we didn't pick. My experience is
that I generally pick the wrong stock if I have to pick one. The stock that
rises could be the one with the most leverage, or the one that's lagged the
others, or perhaps the one that's already the winner and has risen the most, or
the one with the insider buying, or the one with the lowest p/e, etc. etc. etc.
Whatever one I choose, it always seems to be something else that's the really
good performer - assuming there's any performance at all. SO, to reduce my
problem and alleviate my discomfort, I almost invariably go with trying to buy
a package - if not all- of the key players in a given sector. (In other words,
I'm not concerned with finding "best of breed", whatever that is.) So... I will
focus on DEO, and likely buy an exploratory position of it also. (All this a
long-winded way of saying I endorse your 3 part, 3 part, 2 part approach!!)

Disney is hard for me to evaluate because imo it trades on its brand franchise.
The p/e has averaged over 20 for the past ten years, but roe has been lousy.
Only recently have profit margins increased.

DIS is about at my top buy price ($25). I wouldn't pay more than 16 times
earnings for the company. (Forward p/e per Yahoo is about 15.4). A positive - I
hope - is the new management team.

No question many of us here would want to consider buying DIS again if stock
drops under $20. For me, I have only started a very few shares, and I'm
prepared to add if and as the stock breaks under $22 - assuming there's no
really adverse news accompanying the drop. OTOH, if the stock does move up from
here, I'm in for a taste.

High p/e, not great ROE, profit margins seem to be coming down each year for

Buying a few shares of bearing manufacturer, NN Inc.

I like these bearing manufacturers because it seems to me as an outsider, that
bearings are usually a small component of the parts into which they are
inserted - small both in size and in cost. Therefore, I assume it's relatively
easy for the bearing companies to pass along their increased raw material and
labor expenses. I realize it's a competitive business, but for the relatively
small cost of bearings (relative to the customers costs of goods sold),
quality, dependability, customer service are important factors which might be
as important as cost - i.e. switching to a cheaper supplier just on price.

For anybody who in 1976 was reading about Ben Graham (Could there be such a
person besides me on this thread?), NN was mentioned in media reports then as a
typical stock Dr. Graham might buy. Then as now though, my opinion of NN is
that NN is a dull, prosaic company, maybe a step or two from being a cigar
butt. Difference is, this time I'll go for a few shares and see if the company
and stock can soldier on.

In my opinion, VASC has longer term problems as their thrombin is bovine-based.
Below is a quote from an article I posted on the SI VASC, asking for comments.

A new type of thrombin could quickly render the older molecule obsolete. King's
Thrombin-JMI is derived from the blood of cows. Even after a rigorous
purification process, it contains some additional cow-based proteins that
occasionally cause allergic reactions in patients. In rare cases, patients can
become anemic, complicating their recovery from whatever procedure called for
thrombin in the first place.

"[Patients] can have antibodies to bovine-based thrombin, and that can lead to
significant bleeding disorders," says Alvin Schmaier, a hematologist at the
University of Michigan. "Even with purification from cow blood or human blood,
you can still have contaminating proteins, so the best kind of agent to use
would be a recombinant one."

Recombinant is pharmaceutical-speak for genetically engineered. Zymogenetics
(ZGEN4), a Seattle-based biotech, is trying to create the first recombinant
thrombin, called rhThrombin. Analysts say that unlike King's version of the
drug, rhThrombin might not require a black-box warning on the label, the FDA's
most stringent caution of a drug's potential side effects.

Edward Tenthoff, an analyst with Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, is optimistic
that there won't be a black-box warning. "This will be an important competitive
advantage against Thrombin-JMI," he wrote in an August research note. "As a
result, we expect Zymo will rapidly convert the surgical bleeding market, which
we estimate could reach $300 million by the time rhThrombin is approved [in
2007]."

I wish there was a standard interview Q&A. More like an article:

Living Legend

By ANDREW BARY

IRVING KAHN STARTED his long and remarkable career on Wall Street in 1928, and
he's not slowing down, even though he'll be 100 this Monday.

Kahn, the chairman of Kahn Brothers, a low-profile New York investment firm,
might be Wall Street's oldest active investor. He's in the office every
business day, reading scientific periodicals, annual reports and newspapers in
search of undervalued stocks in the tradition of his friend and mentor,
Benjamin Graham, widely considered the father of value investing.

Kahn worked as a teaching assistant for Graham at his lectures at Columbia
University that started in 1928, and he helped Graham with statistical material
for his first major work, Security Analysis, which was co-authored by David
Dodd and published in 1934. Kahn met his wife, Ruth, at one of Graham's early
Columbia lectures. She died in 1996.

Along the way, Kahn got to know many of Graham's famous disciples, including
Warren Buffett. A gutsy Kahn wasn't swept up in what he calls the "crazy
market" of the late 1920s. In fact, his first trade in the summer of 1929
actually was a short sale of Magma Copper that turned out to be a winner in a
few months.

Given his success over a 77-year career, Kahn has no need to work, but he
scoffs at retirement. "It's like I'm married to the business, more so because
my wife isn't here. It's sort of a like a game with me," Kahn said recently at
the firm's midtown Manhattan office. "It's fun to get things right for the
right reason."

Kahn could be on the job for a while longer because he's a member of an
extraordinarily long-lived clan. His oldest sister, Helen "Happy" Reichert, is
104, and his younger brother, Peter, is 95. Kahn's other sister, Lee Reichart,
died in the past year at 101. Only about 1 in 1,000 people in the Kahns'
generation reach 100. The Kahns have been the subject of studies seeking to
unlock the elusive genetic secret of long life. So far, researchers haven't
found much through their genetic sleuthing, except that the Kahns have high
levels of the "good" cholesterol, HDL, which can ward off heart disease.

The pursuit of excellence never gets old. Says Kahn: "It's fun to get things
right for the right reason."

The surviving siblings remain mentally sharp, and Irving is in good physical
condition. In warm weather, he walks the mile from his apartment on Manhattan's
Upper East Side to the firm's offices on Madison Avenue and 55th Street. On a
cold recent afternoon, this reporter rode on a city bus with Kahn from his
office to his home. Although his firm would gladly pick up the tab for a car
service, Kahn finds the $25 cost "obscene," relative to the senior-citizen bus
fare of $1.

Says Kahn Brothers president, Tom Kahn, Irving's 63-year-old son: "My father
continues to research ideas and talk to companies. One of the nice things about
this business is that there's no mandatory retirement age, and you allegedly
get wiser as you get older." And, he adds: "Sometimes I'll talk to a company
and they'll tell me. 'Your father just called last week.' Irving is a voracious
reader. He reads several newspapers a day, plus numerous scientific journals.
He's a frustrated scientist."

Irving Kahn still finds good ideas. A year ago, he unearthed Payless ShoeSource
(ticker: PSS), the country's largest budget-shoe retailer, whose shares were
around 12, just a small premium above book value of $10. Kahn was bullish on
the business because he felt there was a strong need for well-made, inexpensive
shoes -- and the stock was cheap. Payless has since doubled. "I read a lot of
annual reports," Kahn says. "J.C. Penney decided to get rid of Payless." Part
of his research involved buying a pair of Payless leather shoes for $49. He
liked them, and was wearing them at the office last week. "He feels that, at
$99, Rockports are too expensive," jokes Tom Kahn.

A modest man, Irving Kahn isn't crazy about the attention his 100th birthday is
generating. He was honored Tuesday night by the New York Society of Security
Analysts, which he, Graham and several others founded in 1937, when stocks were
largely discredited as an investment and the community of stock analysts --
then called statisticians -- was very small.

About 100 people attended the dinner, including such value-investing luminaries
as Mario Gabelli, Marty Whitman, Charles Royce, Jean-Marie Eveillard and Walter
Schloss. The keynote speaker, Louis Lowenstein, a former Columbia Business
School professor, lauded Kahn as a "model of wisdom and sanity."

AFTER <HIGHLIGHT TYPE="italic">BARRON'S</HIGHLIGHT> SENT a photographer to
Kahn's office last week, he remarked that "taking 60 to 80 pictures of a
middle-aged man" was excessive just to get one good shot. He joked with the
photographer that, since she was attractive, he ought to be taking her picture.

The centenarian will ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on
Dec. 30. Kahn Brothers, started in 1978 by Irving and two of his sons, Alan and
Tom, has owned a Big Board seat since its formation, when it paid $100,000 for
one now worth about $4 million. The Kahns started their own business after
working at Abraham & Co. for nearly two decades. Their firm oversees $800
million for private clients, but has no mutual fund.

The Kahns have been featured in Barron's several times, starting in 1983, when
Tom and his brother, Alan (now 67), were interviewed as the "Net-Net Kahns."
Alan, a noted value investor and a successful shareholder-rights advocate,
separated from the firm this year. A decade ago, Irving was the subject of a
cover story ("True Believer," March 13, 1995) and the three Kahns served up
some profitable stock ideas near a market bottom ("Kahn-Trary Opinions," Oct.
7, 2002). The firm has done well for clients. The average account was up an
annualized 16.6% from Dec. 31, 1994, through Sept. 30, 2005, versus 11.5% for
the S&P 500 and 9.6% for the Russell 2000.

"I would say that we're modified Graham-and-Dodd investors," Tom Kahn adds.
Both he and his father say that finding companies that fit Graham's exacting
financial standards is more difficult now. During much of his investing career,
Graham, who died in 1976, profited by purchasing "net-net" stocks for less than
their working capital -- cash and other liquid assets.

Some Kahn Brothers favorites now include IDT, (IDT) the Newark, N.J.-based
telecom, and Audiovox (VOXX), a maker and distributor of cellphones and
consumer electronics. IDT trades below $12 and is likely to end the year with
nearly $10 a share in cash. Investors therefore are paying little for its
profitable phone-card division, a nascent film-animation business and other
units. Audiovox, at about 13, sells below its book value of $18 and has $7 a
share in cash.

"It's impossible to reverse-engineer Irving's investment process," says Carl
Schecter, the head of risk-arbitrage trading at Nomura Securities in New York
and a long-time Kahn Brothers client. "It's an idiosyncratic mix of top-down
economic insight and bottom-up financial analysis." Schecter cites a China
play, Nam Tai Electronics, an electronics maker, whose shares traded near book
value when Irving recommended it three years ago. The stock has since
quadrupled.

Kahn doesn't dwell on the past. He'd much rather discuss nanotechnology than
reminisce about the Crash of '29.

He's also keen on the New York City Job and Career Center, an organization he
founded in 1986 that helps students at New York City public high schools find
jobs, develop interviewing and resume-writing skills and decide on careers.
Irving points out that guidance counselors at city schools are overwhelmed by
the sheer number of students they need to advise. Irving was a 1923 graduate of
DeWitt Clinton high school in Manhattan. Two years ahead of him at the school
was Roy Neuberger, now 102, a founder of the Neuberger Berman investment firm,
now owned by Lehman Brothers.

Kahn went to City College in New York, but never graduated. "Just like Bill
Gates," he notes. Gates didn't finish Harvard.

Kahn met Graham in 1928. Kahn was working as a clerk at a brokerage firm -- one
of three Wall Street jobs Kahn was holding down at the time. "The head
bookkeeper at the firm was a nice guy, and he saw how skeptical I was about
that crazy market. I asked him if he knew anyone who consistently made money.
He opened the ledger to G for Graham. I went over to Graham's offices at the
Cotton Exchange on Beaver Street and that was the beginning of my career."

Kahn says that he and Graham would take the subway from Wall Street up to
Columbia's business school for Graham's lectures, which began at 4 p.m., an
hour after the market closed in those days. Graham used real-world examples to
illustrate his points. Kahn remembers that in 1929, Graham noted skeptically
that a utility holding company, American & Foreign Power, an Internet stock of
that era, had a larger market value than one of the period's great blue chips,
the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Kahn's passion for science has served him well as an investor. His interest in
the growing global need for clean water led him to companies like Osmonics, a
maker of water purification equipment that was taken over by General Electric
(GE). A long-time believer in the benefits of nuclear power, Kahn has
championed USEC, a formerly government-owned company that enriches uranium. Its
shares sell for around 11. Kahn got excited about Monsanto (MON) two years ago
when it traded in the 20s, because he felt its genetically modified seeds were
being unfairly maligned by environmentalists. "I thought...they were perfectly
safe," he says. Monsanto now is in the 70s.

"The thing that makes our style different from the typical firm is that we read
much more broadly outside Wall Street on subjects like science and technology
to locate trends that are not obvious," Irving says. "One reason that it's hard
for many people to manage money is that they're influenced by what other people
do. Buffett's not like that."

Alan Kahn says his father has an "unbounded curiosity about everything. Wide
reading leads to the uncovering of investment ideas." Irving Kahn has thousands
of books -- nearly all non-fiction -- in his apartment and several thousand
more at his house in Rockaway, a seaside community in Queens about 15 miles
from Manhattan where Kahn and his wife raised their three children.

"My dad says he doesn't have time to read fiction," Tom Kahn says. "I remember
as a kid he would come home with a briefcase full of annual reports. His
business is his hobby. He doesn't play golf or bridge, and he gave up tennis a
while ago."

With Irving Kahn's zest for his profession, this Wall Street patriarch could be
uncovering undervalued stocks and offering inspiration for years to come.

I forgot one that he had me in UGLX...

The shares of MTIC...have been a loss of over eight thousand. He did not do
right by me and I not longer have my account with him.

Thank you for the information on NPTH.. Also, VASC... and not UGLX... Don't

to three of four dollars a share.

I have some nice tax losses.. However, I don't need them.

Suma: When you sign on with a broker you should have been required to inform
them what type of investor you are - the kinds of stocks you are looking for,
as conservative,low risk or more risky growth stuff. Those stocks he got for
you were dink, otc stocks. The significant commonality among them seems to me
on a quick scan that they were always or mostly unprofitable. Imo, an odd
package to buy for somebody who's "retired". A strange selection even for
somebody who's looking to gamble with fun money. Well, jmo.

Hi Sam - I noticed that Kahn Bros largest holding is NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANC

his holdings. I like this one too.

This is an interesting list.

You are correct..

When I chose to utilize his services I had only one request and that was to
invest in whatever he bought for himself and his mother, who is a few years
younger than myself. For years she had raved about how well her son had done
for her. She rattled off the profits he made and that piqued my interest.

I did not think he would in any way use poor judgment when it came to his
mother. Since that event... three years ago, I am not that friendly with the
mother. AND I took my account away from her son. But the losses are not going
to go away.

It seemed every time he would call me to buy something the next day there would
be a controversy or lawsuit or something and the price would drop
precipitously. The one stock CNXS that he got received some very negative news
the week after he bought it and I insisted he sell .. It was the only one that
would have made money. IRONY.

I checked out the option premiums of ZGEN and unfortunately they do not
correlate with the premiums of VASC...however, that is not to say they won't
eventually correlate and/or that the their is some other type of arbitrage
set-up with the common or that the market doesn't care about ZGEN and only
cares about the impact ZGEN's drug has on VASC. On the surface ZGEN's
rhThrombin sounds like a <u>huge</u> threat to VASC's market cap, but I'm not a
biotech guy, I'm analyzing options to find event related set-ups for pair
trading arbitrage.

At what stage is the progress of ZGEN's rhThrombin? ie Phase I, II, or III or
something else entirely?

What are the analysts saying about timeframe of ZGEN next biggest milestone?

I would start getting real excited about this situation if I saw that the Rate
of Change in Implied Volatility of ZGEN started to rise beyond it's 52 week
high. For me that would be the tell all sign that this event is related to
these two companies...

For now, though, this seems to be the best explanation of the unusually high
premiums of VASC.

Thanks for the post!

I bought a retailer as well today - BBY.
Saw a CNBC interview last week, the person being interviewed is of the opinion
that the perceived shortfall this quarter can be mostly attributed to
investments which will bear fruit in the future (Geek Squad, etc.) He felt it
was a great long term buy.
It's getting more heat today because CC reported surprisingly strong results,
some feel at BBY's expense.
I will say I almost exclusively shop at BBY or online for electronics, and when
I was there this weekend, the place was packed (and people were lining up
outside for XBox 360!) I haven't shopped CC in years, nor do I plan to.

I will also say I'm already underwater on my position....

Jurgis Bekepuris. I find it sad and worse that PIR is the only and best pick
that you chose when there seem to me so many other and possibly better choices
that have been mentioned here and elsewhere.

That said, there's the other side:

It's what one buys that counts, not what one doesn't buy and not what other
people are buying or might expect somebody else to buy. It's what happens to
PIR and if it meets your requirements - your style of investing and your goals.
--------------------------------------------
I added a few shares to my losing position of CPWM today. CPWM and PIR are in
the same sector (mostly), and sometimes trade on similar news. (And the news is
not so good today.) I like CPWM because it has a more diverse product line
(food, beverages, etc.) OTOH, PIR might be the better bet: Warren Buffett liked
PIR at much higher prices; PIR has better profit margins than CPWM, better d/e
ratios.

Wallace Rivers. I don't shop CC either, but the stock would've been a good buy
- maybe better than BBY at the time - if one bought in the $16 range after the
BOD had rejected a $17 takeover offer a few months ago.

I never dealt with a broker except one time 3 years ago. I was attracted to
Morgan's fee based brokerage account which let me (or the broker on my behalf )
trade for 1.5% fixed fee's/year. I asked him to provide me a list of 5 stocks
he liked and would put me in. I didn't like the stocks on his buy list so i
told him I would watch the stocks he recommended and would come back in a year
if i liked their performance. The performance of his picks was so bad, he never
even bothered to call me again even though he had my phone number :-).

You make a good point for advice on some of these S.I. boards.. After awhile we
can sort out those whom we trust, whose advice seems to be on the up and up...
and those who are buying the stocks themselves.. Making a decision for
ourselves is difficult. I will personalize that. I have a hard time knowing
what stocks to buy.. There are to many. But that's not unusual . At the ice
cream store I have a hard time choosing the flavor I want also... Pisces...

RHA :- This stock seems to be called "Rhodia SA (RHA)" at Yahoo and "Rhodia
ADS" at another financial web site I frequent.
Strangely, only Yahoo reports a dividend payout of 43c/share while the other
site shows no dividend.
But what is even more puzzling is the fact that, according to RHA’s Quarterly
Financial Statement, published on the 16 Dec. 2005, this company is Technically
Insolvent (Total Liabilities = $7,365mil. and Total Assets = $6,576mil.
according to Yahoo).
In addition to that :-
a) It has reported a Bottom line LOSS for the last 4 Annual Results in a row
b) It has reported a Bottom Line LOSS for the last 4 Quarterly Results in a
row.
Taking these aspects into account, it seems very strange that a company, which
is Insolvent and has been losing money on a regular basis, should be paying its
Ordinary Shareholders what one assumes is an Ordinary Dividend.
Maybe Yahoo have got their "facts" wrong.

I assume that when you say that, "we don't have enough participation" you mean
that there is not "enough participation" on this message board, correct?

There was a brief article in the WSJ about a week or two ago and the gist was
that everyone is a contrarian now. This complaint has also been stated by
several PMs (Tilson & Klarman come to mind) stating that everyone is a "value
investor" now or at least thinks they are a value investor.
